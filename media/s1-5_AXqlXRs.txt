   Here now have you (most dear, and most worthy to be most dear lady) this idle work of mine, which, I fear, like the spider’s web, will be thought fitter to be swept away than worn to any other purpose. For my part, in very truth (as the cruel fathers among the Greeks were wont to do to the babes they would not foster) I could well find in my heart to cast out in some desert of forgetfulness this child which I am loth to father. But you desired me to do it, and your desire to my heart is an absolute commandment Now it is done only for you, only to you: if you keep it to yourself or to such friends who will weigh errors in the balance of goodwill, I hope, for the father’s sake, it will be pardoned, perchance made much of, though in itself it have deformities. For indeed, for severer eyes it is not, being but a trifle, and that triflingly handled. Your dear self can best witness the manner, being done in loose sheets of paper, most of it in your presence; the rest by sheets sent unto you as fast as they were done. In sum, a young head, not so well stayed as I would it were (and shall be when God will) having many many fancies begotten in it, if it had not been in some way delivered, would have grown a monster; and more sorry might I be that they came in than that they gat out But his chief safety shall be the not walking abroad; and his chief protection, the bearing the livery of your name, which (if much much goodwill do not deceive me) is worthy to be a sanctuary for a greater offender. This say I, because I know the virtue so; and this say I, because it may be ever so, or, to say better, because it will be ever so. Read it, then, at your idle times, and the follies your good judgement will find in it blame not, but laugh at And so, looking for no better stuff than as in a haberdasher’s shop, glasses or feathers, you will continue to love the writer, who doth exceedingly love you, and most heartily prays you may long live to be a principal ornament to the family of the Sidneys. Your loving brother,

   To the Reader
   
   The disfigured face, gentle reader, wherewith this work not long since appeared to the common view, moved that noble lady to whose honour consecrated, to whose protection it was committed, to take in hand the wiping away those spots wherewith the beauties thereof were unworthily blemished. But as often in repairing a ruinous house the mending of some old part occasioneth the making of some new, so here her honourable labour, begun in correcting the faults, ended in supplying the defects, by the view of what was ill done guided to the consideration of what was not done. Which part with what advice entered into, with what success it hath been passed through (most by her doing, all by her directing), if they may be entreated not to define which are unfurnished of means to discern, the rest, it is hoped, will favourably censure. But this they shall for their better satisfaction understand, that though they find not here what might be expected, they may find nevertheless as much as was intended, the conclusion, not the perfection of Arcadia, and that no further than the author’s own writings or known determinations could direct Whereof who sees not the reason must consider there may be reason which he sees not. Albeit I dare affirm he either sees or, from wiser judgements than his own, may hear that Sir Philip Sidney’s writings can no more be perfected without Sir Philip Sidney than Apelles’ pictures without Apelles. There are that think contrary, and no wonder. Never was Arcadia free from the cumber of such cattle. ‘To us,’ say they, ‘the pastures are not pleasant; and as for the flowers - such as we light on we take no delight in, but the greater part grow not within our reach.’ Poor souls! What talk they of flowers! They are roses not flowers must do them good, which, if they find not here, they shall do well to go feed elsewhere: any place will better like them; for without Arcadia nothing grows in more plenty than lettuce suitable to their lips.® If it be true that likeness is a great cause of liking and that contraries infer contrary consequences, then is it true that the worthless reader can never worthily esteem of so worthy a writing; and as true that the noble, the wise, the virtuous, the courteous, as many as have had any acquaintance with true learning and knowledge, will with all love and dearness entertain it, as well for affinity with themselves as being child to such a father. Whom albeit it do not exactly and in every lineament represent, yet considering the father's untimely death prevented the timely birth of the child, it may happily seem a thank-worthy labour that the defects being so few, so small and in no principal part, yet the greatest unlikeness is rather in defect than in deformity. But howsoever it is, it is now by more than one interest The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia - done, as it was, for her; as it is, by her. Neither shall these pains be the last (if no unexpected accident cut off her determination) which the everlasting love of her excellent brother will make her consecrate to his memory.

   The First Book
   CHAPTER 1
   It was in the time that the earth begins to put on her new apparel against the approach of her lover, and that the sun, running a most even course, becomes an indifferent arbiter between the night and the day, when the hopeless shepherd Strephon was come to the sands which lie against the island of Cithera; where viewing the place with a heavy kind of delight, and sometimes casting his eyes to the isleward, he called his friendly rival, the pastor Claius, unto him; and setting first down in his darkened countenance a doleful copy of what he would speak,
   'O my Claius,’ said he, 'hither we are now come to pay the rent for which we are so called unto by over-busy remembrance - remembrance, restless remembrance, which claims not only this duty of us but for it will have us forget ourselves. I pray you, when we were amid our flock, and that of other shepherds some were running after their sheep strayed beyond their bounds, some delighting their eyes with seeing them nibble upon the short and sweet grass, some medicining their sick ewes, some setting a bell for an ensign of a sheepish squadron, some with more leisure inventing new games of exercising their bodies and sporting their wits; did remembrance grant us any holiday either for pastime or devotion - nay either for necessary food or natural rest - but that still it forced our thoughts to work upon this place where we last (alas, that the word last should so long last) did graze our eyes upon her ever-flourishing beauty? Did it not still cry within us “Ah, you base-minded wretches, are your thoughts so deeply be- mired in the trade or ordinary wordlings, as for respect of gain some paltry wool may yield you, to let so much time pass without knowing perfectly her estate, especially in so troublesome a season; to leave that shore unsaluted from whence you may see to the island where she dwelleth; to leave those steps unkissed wherein Urania printed the farewell of all beauty?”
   ‘Well, then, remembrance commanded; we obeyed, and here we find that as our remembrance came ever clothed unto us in the form of this place, so this place gives new heat to the fever of our languishing remembrance. Yonder, my Claius, Urania lighted. The very horse, methought, bewailed to be so disburdened. And as for thee, poor Claius, when thou wen test to help her down, I saw reverence and desire so divide thee that thou didst at one instant both blush and quake, and instead of bearing her wert ready to fall down thyself. There she sat, vouchsafing my cloak (then most gorgeous) under her. At yonder rising of the ground she turned herself, looking back towards her wonted abode, and because of her parting, bearing much sorrow in her eyes, the lightsomeness whereof had yet so natural a cheerfulness as it made even sorrow seem to smile. At that turning she spake to us all, opening the cherry of her lips, and Lord, how greedily mine ears did feed upon the sweet words she uttered! And here she laid her hand over thine eyes, when she saw the tears springing in them, as if she would conceal them from other and yet herself feel some of thy sorrow. But woe is me, yonder, yonder, did she put her foot into the boat, at that instant, as it were, dividing her heavenly beauty between the earth and the sea. But when she was embarked, did you not mark how the winds whistled and the seas danced for joy, how the sails did swell with pride, and all because they had Urania? O Urania, blessed be thou, Urania, the sweetest fairness and fairest sweetness!'
   With that word his voice brake so with sobbing that he could say no further, and Claius thus answered:
   ‘Alas, my Strephon,' said he, ‘what needs this score to reckon up only our losses? What doubt is there but that the sight of this place doth call our thoughts to appear at the court of affection, held by that racking steward remembrance? As well may sheep forget to fear when they spy wolves as we can miss such fancies when we see any place made happy by her treading. Who can choose that saw her but think where she stayed, where she walked, where she turned, where she spoke? But what is all this? Truly no more but as this place served us to think of those things, so those things serve as places to call to memory more excellent matters. No, no, let us think with consideration, and consider with acknowledging, and acknowledge with admiration, and admire with love, and love with joy in the midst of all woes. Let us in such sort think, I say, that our poor eyes were so enriched as to behold, and our low hearts so exalted as to love, a maid who is such that as the greatest thing the world can shew is her beauty, so the least thing that may be praised in her is her beauty. Certainly as her eye-lids are more pleasant to behold than two white kids climbing up a fair tree and browsing on its tenderest branches, and yet are nothing compared to the day-shining stars contained in them; and as her breath is more sweet than a gentle south-west wind which comes creeping over flowery fields and shadowed waters in the extreme heat of summer, and yet is nothing compared to the honey-flowing speech that breath doth carry; no more all that our eyes can see of her (though when they have seen her, what else they shall ever see is but dry stubble after clover-grass) is to be matched with the flock of unspeakable virtues laid up delightfully in that best-builded fold. But indeed, as we can better consider the sun's beauty by marking how he gilds these waters and mountains than by looking upon his own face, too glorious for our weak eyes, so it may be our conceits (not able to bear her sun-staining excellency) will better weigh it by her works upon some meaner subject employed. And alas, who can better witness that than we, whose experience is grounded upon feeling? Hath not the only love of her made us, being silly ignorant shepherds, raise up our thoughts above the ordinary level of the world, so as great clerks do not disdain our conference? Hath not the desire to seem worthy in her eyes made us, when others were sleeping, to sit viewing the course of the heavens; when others were running at Base, to run over learned writings;  when others mark their sheep, we to mark ourselves? Hath not she thrown reason upon our desires and, as it were, given eyes unto Cupid? Hath in any but in her, love-fellowship maintained friendship between rivals, and beauty taught the beholders chastity?’
   He was going on with his praises, but Strephon bade him stay and look: and so they both perceived a thing which floated, drawing nearer and nearer to the bank, but rather by the favourable working of the sea than by any self-industry. They doubted a while what it should be till it was cast up even hard before them, at which time they fully saw that it was a man. Whereupon running for pity’s sake unto him, they found his hands (as it should appear, constanter friends to his life than his memory) fast gripping upon the edge of a square small coffer which lay all under his breast: else in himself no show of life, so as the board seemed to be but a bier to carry him a-land to his sepulchre. So drew they up a young man of so goodly shape and well-pleasing favour that one would think death had in him a lovely countenance, and that, though he were naked, nakedness was to him an apparel. That sight increased their compassion, and their compassion called up their care; so that lifting his feet above his head, making a great deal of salt water come out of his mouth, they laid him upon some of their garments and fell to rub and chafe him till they brought him to recover both breath, the servant, and warmth, the companion, of living. At length opening his eyes, he gave a great groan (a doleful note, but a pleasant ditty, for by that they found not only life but strength of life in him). They therefore continued on their charitable office until, his spirits being well returned, he - without so much as thanking them for their pains - gat up, and looking round about to the uttermost limits of sight, and crying upon the name of Pyrocles, nor seeing nor hearing cause of comfort:
   ‘What,’ said he, ‘and shall Musidorus live after Pyrocles’ destruction?’
   Therewithal he offered wilfully to cast himself again into the sea: a strange sight to the shepherds, to whom it seemed that before, being in appearance dead had yet saved his life, and nowp coming to his life should be a cause to procure his death; but they ran unto him, and pulling him back (then too feeble for them) by force stickled that unnatural fray.
   I pray you,’ said he, ‘honest men, what such right have you in me as not to suffer me to do with myself what I list, and what policy have you to bestow a benefit where it is counted an injury?’
   They hearing him speak in Greek (which was their natural language) became the more tender-hearted towards him, and considering by his calling and looking that the loss of some dear friend was great cause of his sorrow, told him they were poor men that were bound by course of humanity to prevent so great a mischief; and that they wished him, if opinion of some body’s perishing bred such desperate anguish in him, that he should be comforted by his own proof, who had lately escaped as apparent danger as any might be.
   ‘No, no,' said he, ‘it is not for me to attend so high a blissfulness: but since you take care of me, I pray you find means that some barque may be provided that will go out of the haven, that if it be possible we may find the body, far, far too precious a food for fishes: and for the hire,’ said he, ‘I have within this casket of value sufficient to content them.'
   Claius presently went to a fisherman, and having agreed with him, and provided some apparel for the naked stranger, he embarked, and the shepherds with him; and were no sooner gone beyond the mouth of the haven but that some way into the sea they might discern, as it were, a stain of the water’s colour, and by times some sparks and smoke mounting thereout. But the young man no sooner saw it but that beating his breast he cried that there was the beginning of his ruin, entreating them to bend their course as near unto it as they could; telling how that smoke was but a small relique of a great fire which had driven both him and his friend rather to commit themselves to the cold mercy of the sea than to abide the hot cruelty of the fire; and that therefore, though they both had abandoned the ship, that he was (if anywhere) in that course to be met withal.
   They steered therefore as near thither-ward as they could; but when they came so near as their eyes were full masters of the object, they saw a sight full of piteous strangeness: a ship, or rather the carcase of the ship, or rather some few bones of the carcase hulling there, part broken, part burned, part drowned - death having used more than one dart to that destruction. About it floated great store of very rich things and many chests which nught promise no less. And amidst the precious things were a number of dead bodies, which likewise did not only testify both elements’ violence, but that the chief violence was grown of human inhumanity; for their bodies were full of grisly wounds, and their blood had (as it were) filled the wrinkles of the sea’s visage, which it seemed the sea would not wash away that it might witness it is not always his fault when we condemn his cruelty. In sum, a defeat where the conquered kept both field and spoil; a shipwreck without storm or ill-footing, and a waste of fire in the midst of water.
   But a little way off they saw the mast, whose proud height now lay along, like a widow having lost her mate of whom she held her honour: but upon the mast they saw a young man - at least if he Were a man - bearing show of about eighteen years of age, who sat as on horse back, having nothing upon him but his shirt which, being wrought with blue silk and gold, had a kind of resemblance to the sea on which the sun (then near his western home) did shoot some of his beams. His hair (which the young men of Greece used to wear very long) was stirred up and down with the wind, which seemed to have a sport to play with it as the sea had to kiss his feet; himself full of admirable beauty, set forth by the strangeness both of his seat and gesture. For holding his heau up full of unmoved majesty, he held a sword aloft with his fair arm, which often he waved about his crown as though he would threaten the world in that extremity.
   But the fishermen, when they came so near him that it was time to throw out a rope by which hold they might draw him, their simplicity bred such amazement and their amazement such a superstition that (assuredly thinking it was some God begotten between Neptune and Venus that had made all this terrible slaughter), as they went under sail by him, held up their hands and made their prayers. Which when Musidorus saw, though he were almost as much ravished with joy as they with astonishment, he leaped to the mariner and took the rope out of his hand, and saying, ‘Dost thou live, and art thou well!’ who answered, ‘Thou canst tell best, since most of my well-being stands in thee’, threw it out.
   But already the ship w'as passed beyond Pyrocles; and therefore Musidorus could do no more but persuade the mariners to cast about again, assuring them that he was but a man although of most divine excellencies, and promising great rewards for their pain.
   And now they w'ere already come upon the stays, when one of the sailors descried a galley which came with sails and ors directly in the chase of them, and straight perceived it was a well- known pirate W'ho hunted not only for goods but for bodies of men which he employed either to be his galley-slaves or to sell at the best market. Which when the master understood, he commanded forthwith to set on all thecanvas they could and fly homeward, leaving in that sort poor Pyrocles so near to be rescued. But what did not Musidorus say, wiiat did he not offer to persuade them to venture the fight! But fear standing at the gates of their ears put back all persuasions, so that he had nothing wherewith to accompany Pyrocles but his eyes, nor to succour him but his wishes. Therefore praying for him, and casting a long look that way, he saw the galley leave the pursuit of them and turn to take up the spoils of the other wreck. And lastly he might well see them lift up the young man; and ‘Alas,’ said he to himself, ‘dear Pyrocles, shall that body of thine be enchained? Shall those victorious hands of thine be commanded to base offices? Shall virtue become a slave to those that be slaves to viciousness? Alas, better had it been thou hadst ended nobly thy noble days. What death is so evil as unworthy servitude?'
   But that opinion soon ceased when he saw the galley setting upon another ship which held long and strong fight with her; for then he began afresh to fear the life of his friend and to wish well to the pirates whom before he hated, lest in their ruin he perish. But the fishermen made such speed into the haven that they absented his eyes from beholding the issue; where being entered, he could procure neither them nor any other as then to put themselves into the sea: so that being as full of sorrow for being unable to do anything as void of counsel how to do anything, besides that sickness grew something upon him, the honest shepherds Strephon and Claius (who being themselves true friends did the more perfectly judge the justness of his sorrow) advised him that he should mitigate somewhat of his woe since he had gotten an amendment in fortune, being come from assured persuasion of his death to have no cause to despair of his life - as one that had lamented the death of his sheep should after know they were but strayed would receive pleasure, though readily he knew not where to find them.
   CHAPTER 2
   ‘Now, Sir,’ said they, ‘thus for ourselves it is. We are in profession but shepherds and in this country of Laconia little better than strangers, and therefore neither in skill nor ability of power greatly to stead you. But what we can present unto you is this: Arcadia, of which country we are, is but a little way hence; and even upon the next confines there dwelleth a gentleman, by name Kalander, who vouchsafeth much favour unto us: a man who for his hospitality is so much haunted that no news stirs but comes to his ears; for his upright dealing so beloved of his neighbours that he hath many ever ready to do him their uttermost service; and by the great goodwill our prince bears him, may soon obtain the use of his name and credit, which hath a principal sway not only in his own Arcadia but in all these countries of Peloponnesus: and - which is worth all - all these things give him not so much power as his nature gives him will to benefit, so that it seems no music is so sweet to his ears as deserved thanks. To him we will bring you, and there you may recover again your health, without which you cannot be able to make any diligent search for your friend, and therefore you must labour for it. Besides, we are sure the comfort of courtesy and ease of wise counsel shall not be wanting.'
   Musidorus (who, besides he was merely unacquainted in the country, had his wits astonished with sorrow) gave easy consent tc that from which he saw no reason to disagree: and therefore (defraying the mariners with a ring bestowed upon them) they took their journey together through Laconia; Claius and Strephon by course carrying his chest for him, Musidorus only bearing in his countenance evident marks of a sorrowful mind supported with a weak body; wliich they perceiving, and knowing that the violence of sorrow is not, at the first, to be striven withal (being like a mighty beast, sooner tamed with following than overthrown by withslanding) they gave way unto it for that day and the next; never troubling him either with asking questions or finding fault with his melancholy, but rather fitting to his dolour dolorous discourses of their own and other folks’ misfortunes. Which speeches, though they had not a lively entrance to his senses shut up in sorrow, yet like one half asleep he took hold of much of the matters spoken unto him, so as a man may say, ere sorrow was aware, they made his thoughts bear away something else beside his own sorrow; which wrought so in him that at length he grew content to mark their speeches, then to marvel at such wit in shepherds, after to like their company, and lastly to vouchsafe conference. So that the third day after, in the time that the morning did strew roses and violets in the heavenly floor against the coming of the sun, the nightingales (striving one with the other which could in most dainty variety recount their wrong- caused sorrow) made them put off their sleep, and rising from under a tree (which that night had been their pavilion) they went on their journey, which by and by welcomed Musidorus’ eyes, wearied with the wasted soil of Laconia, with delightful prospects.
   There were hills which garnished their proud heights with stately trees; humble valleys whose base estate seemed comforted with refreshing of silver rivers; meadows enamelled with all sorts of eye-pleasing flowers; thickets, which, being lined with most pleasant shade, were witnessed so to by the cheerful deposition of many well-tuned birds; each pasture stored with sheep feeding with sober security, while the pretty lambs with bleating oratory craved the dams’ comfort; here a shepherd’s boy piping as though he should never be old; there a young shepherdess knitting and withal singing, and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to work and her hands kept time to her voice’s music. As for the houses of the country - for many houses came under their eye - they were all scattered, no two being one by the other, and yet not so far off as that it barred mutual succour: a show, as it were, of an accompanable solitariness and of a civil wildness.
   ‘I pray you/ said Musidorus, then first unsealing his long silent lips, ‘what countries be these we pass through which are so divers in show, the one wanting no store, the other having no store but of want?'
   ‘The country/ answered Claius, ‘where you were cast ashore and now are passed through is Laconia, not so poor by the barrenness of the soil (though in itself not passing fertile) as by a civil war, which being these two years within the bowels of that estate between the gentlemen and the peasants (by them named Helots) hath in this sort as it were disfigured the face of nature, and made it so unhospital as now you have found it: the towns neither of the one side nor the other willingly opening their gates to strangers, nor strangers willingly entering for fear of being mistaken.
   ‘But this country where now you set your foot is Arcadia; and even hard by is the house of Kalander whither we lead you: this country being thus decked with peace and (the child of peace) good husbandry. These housesyou see so scattered are of men as we two are that live upon the commodity of their sheep, and therefore in the division of the Arcadian estate are termed shepherds: a happy people, wanting little because they desire not much.'
   ‘What cause then/ said Musidorus, ‘made you venture to leave this sweet life and put yourself in yonder unpleasant and dangerous realm?'
   ‘Guarded with poverty/ answered Strephon, ‘and guided with love.'
   ‘But now/ said Claius, ‘since it hath pleased you to ask anything of us, whose baseness is such as the very knowledge is darkness, give us leave to know something of you and of the young
   man you so much lament, that at least we may be the better instructed to inform Kalander, and he the better know how to proportion his entertainment.'
   Musidorus, according to the agreement between Pyrocles and him to alter their names, answered that he called himself Palladius and his friend Daiphantus; ‘but till I have him again,’ said he, ‘I am indeed nothing, and therefore my story is of nothing. His entertainment (since so good a man he is) cannot be so low as I account my estate; and in sum, the sum of all his courtesy may be to help me by some means to seek my friend.'
   They perceived he was not willing to open himself further, and therefore without further questioning brought him to the house; about which they might see (with fit consideration both of the air, the prospect, and the nature of the ground) all such necessary additions to a great house as might well show Kalander knew that provision is the foundation of hospitality and thrift the fuel of magnificence. The house itself was built of fair and strong stone, not affecting so much any extraordinary kind of fineness as an honourable representing of a firm stateliness. The lights, doors and stairs rather directed to the use of the guest than to the eye of the artificer; and yet as the one chiefly heeded, so the other not neglected; each place handsome without curiosity and homely without loathsomeness; not so dainty as not to be trod on, nor yet slubbered up with good fellowship; all more lasting than beautiful but that the consideration of the exceeding lastingness made the eye believe it was exceeding beautiful. The servants, not so many in number as cleanly in apparel and serviceable in behaviour, testifying even in their countenances that their master took as well care to be served as of them that did serve. One of them • was forthwith ready to welcome the shepherds as men whom, though they were poor, their master greatly favoured; and understanding by them that the young man with them was to be much accounted of, for that they had seen tokens of more than common greatness (howsoever now eclipsed with fortune) he ran to his master; who came presently forth, and pleasantly welcoming the shepherds, but especially applying him to Musidorus, Strephon privately told him all what he knew of him, and particularly that he found this stranger was loth to be known,
   ‘No,’said Kalander speaking aloud, ‘I am no herald to inquire of men’s pedigrees; it sufficeth me if I know their virtues, which (if this young man’s face be not a false witness) do better apparel his mind than you have done his body.'
   While he was thus speaking, there came a boy in show like a merchant’s prentice who, taking Strephon by the sleeve, delivered him a letter written jointly both to him and Claius from Urania, which they no sooner had read but that with short leave taking of Kalander (who quickly guessed and smiled at the matter) and once again, though hastily, recommending the young man unto him, they went away, leaving Musidorus even loth to part with them for the good conversation he had of them and obligation he accounted himself tied in unto them. And therefore, they delivering his chest unto him, he opened it and would have presented them with two very rich jewels, but they absolutely refused them, telling him that they were more than enough rewarded in the knowing of him; and without hearkening unto a reply (like men whose hearts disdained all desires but one) gat speedily away, as if the letter had brought wings to make them fly. But by that sight Kalander soon judged that his guest was of no mean calling; and therefore the more respectfully entertaining him, Musidorus found his sickness (which the fight, the sea and late travel had laid upon him) grow greatly, so that fearing some sudden accident, he delivered the chest to Kalander, which was full of most precious stones gorgeously and cunningly set in divers manners, desiring him he would keep those trifles, and if he died, he would bestow so much of it as was needful to find out and redeem a young man naming himself Daiphantus, as then in the hands of Laconia pirates.
   But Kalander, seeing him faint more and more, with careful speed conveyed him to the most commodious lodging in his house, where being possessed with an extreme burning fever he continued some while with no great hope of life. But youth at length got the victory of sickness, so that in six weeks the excellency of his returned beauty was a credible ambassador of his health, to the great joy of Kalander who, as in this time he had by certain friends of his that dwelt near the sea in Messcnia set forth a ship and a galley to seek and succour Daiphantus, so at home did he omit nothing which he thought might either profit or gratify Pal ladius.
   For having found in him (besides his bodily gifts beyond the degree of admiration) by daily discourses which he delighted himself to have with him, a mind of most excellent composition, a piercing wit quite void of ostentation, high erected thoughts seated in a heart of courtesy, an eloquence as sweet in the uttering as slow to come to the uttering, a behaviour so noble as gave a majesty to adversity, and all in a man whose age could not be above one and twenty years, the good old man was even enamoured with a fatherly love towards him, or rather became his servant by the bonds such virtue laid upon him: once he acknowledged himself so to be by the badge of diligent attendance.
   CHAPTER 3
   But Palladius having gotten his health, and only staying there to be in place where he might hear answer of the^ships set forth, Kalander one afternoon led him abroad to a well-arrayed ground he had behind his house, which he thought to show him before his going as the place himself more than in any other delighted. The backside of the house was neither field, garden nor orchard, or rather it was both field, garden and orchard; for as soon as the descending of the stairs had delivered them down, they came into a place cunningly set with trees of the most taste-pleasing fruits; but scarcely they had taken that into their consideration but that they were suddenly stept into a delicate green; of each side of the green a thicket, and behind the thickets again new beds of flowers, which being under the trees, the trees were to them a pavilion and they to the trees a mosaical floor, so that it seemed that Art therein would needs be delightful by counterfeiting his enemy Error and making order in confusion.
   In the midst of all the place was a fair pond whose shaking crystal was a perfect mirror to all the other beauties, so that it bare show of two gardens; one in deed, the other in shadows. And in one of the thickets was a fine fountain made thus: a naked Venus of white marble, wherein the graver had used such cunning, that the natural blue veins of the marble were framed in fit places to set forth the beautiful veins of her body. At her breast she had her babe Aeneas, who seemed, having begun to suck, to leave that to look upon her fair eyes which smiled at the babe’s folly, meanwhile the breast running.
   Hard by was a house of pleasure built for a summer retiring- place; whither Kalander leading him, he found a square room full of delightful pictures made by the most excellent workman of Greece. There was Diana when Actaeon saw her bathing, in whose cheeks the painter had set such a colour as was mixed between shame and disdain; and one of her foolish nymphs, who weeping and withal louring, one might see the workman meant to set forth tears of anger. In another table wasAtalanta,the posture of whose limbs was so lively expressed, that if the eyes were the only judges as they be the only seers, one would have sworn the very picture had run. Besides many more, as of Helena, Omphale, Iole: but in none of them all beauty seemed to speak so much as in a large table which contained a comely old man, with a lady of middle-age but of excellent beauty; and more excellent would have been deemed, but that there stood between them a young maid whose wonderfulness took away all beauty from her but that which it might seem she gave her back again by her very shadow. And such difference (being known that it did indeed counterfeit a person living) was there between her and all the other (though goddesses) that it seemed the skill of the painter bestowed on the other new beauty, but that the beauty of her bestowed new skill of the painter. Though he thought inquisitiveness an uncomely guest, he could not choose but ask who she was that, bearing show of one being in deed, could with natural gifts go beyond the reach of invention. Kalander answered that it was made by Philoclea, the younger daughter of his prince who also with his wife were contained in that table, the painter meaning to represent the present condition of the young lady, who stood watched by an over-curious eye of her parents; and that he would also have drawn her eldest sister (esteemed her match for beauty) in her shepherdish attire, but that the rude clown her guardian would not suffer it; neither durst he ask leave of the prince for fear of suspicion. Palladius pcrceived that the matter was wrapped up in some secrecy, and therefore would for modesty demand no further; but yet his countenance could not but with dumb eloquence desire it.
   Which Kalander perceiving, ‘Well,’ said he, 'my dear guest, I know your mind and I will satisfy it. Neither will I do it like a niggardly answerer, going no further than the bounds of the question; but I will discover unto you as well that wherein my knowledge is common with others as that which by extraordinary means is delivered unto me, knowing so much in you (though not long acquainted) that I shall find your ears faithful treasurers.’ So then sitting down in two chairs and sometimes casting his eye to the picture, he thus spake:
   ‘This country Arcadia among all the provinces of Greece hath ever been had in singular reputation; partly for the sweetness of the air and other natural benefits, but principally for the well- tempered minds of the people who (finding that the shining title of glory, so much affected by other nations, doth indeed help little to the happiness of life) are the only people which, as by their justice and providence give neither cause nor hope to their neighbours to annoy them, so are they not stirred with false praise to trouble others' quiet, thinking it a small reward for the wasting of their own lives in ravening that their posterity shou'd long after say they had done so. Even the Muses seem to approve their good determination by choosing this country for their chief repairing place, and by bestowing their perfections so largely here that the very shepherds have their fancies lifted to so high conceits that the learned of other nations are content both to borrow their names and imitate their cunning.
   ‘Here dwelleth and reigneth this prince (whose picture you see) by name Basilius; a prince of sufficient skill to govern so quiet a country, where the good minds of the former princes had set down good laws, and the well-bringing up of the people did serve as a most sure bond to hold them. But to be plain with you, he excels in nothing so much as in the zealous love of his people, wherein he doth not only pass all his own foregoers but, as I think, all the princes living. Whereof the cause is that though he exceed not in the virtues which get admiration, as depth of wisdom, height of courage and largeness of magnificence, yet is he notable in those which stir affection, as truth of word, meekness, courtesy, mercifulness and liberality.
   ‘He, being already well stricken in years, married a young princess named Gyneria, daughter to the king of Cyprus, of notable beauty as by her picture you see: a woman of great wit, and in truth of more princely virtues than her husband; of most unspotted chastity, but of so working a mind and so vehement spirits as a man may say it was happy she took a good course, for otherwise it would have been terrible.
   ‘Of these two are brought into the world two daughters, so beyond measure excellent in all the gifts allotted to reasonable creatures that we may think they were born to show that nature is no stepmother to that sex, how much soever some men, sharp-witted only in evil speaking, have sought to disgrace them. The elder is named Pamela, by many men not deemed inferior to her sister. For my part, when I marked them both, methought there was (if at least such perfections may receive the word of more) more sweetness in Philoclea but more majesty in Pamela: methought love played in Philoclea’s eyes and threatened in Pamela’s; methought Philoclea’s beauty only persuaded, but so persuaded as all hearts must yield; Pamela’s beauty used violence, and such violence as no heart could resist And it seems that such proportion is between their minds: Philoclea so bashful, as though her excellencies had stolen into her before she was aware; so humble, that she will put all pride out of countenance; in sum, such proceeding as will stir hope but teach hope good manners. Pamela of high thoughts, who avoids not pride with not knowing her excellencies, but by making that one of her excellencies to be void of pride; her mother’s wisdom, greatness, nobility, but - if I can guess aright - knit with a more constant temper. Now then, our Basilius - being so publicly happy as to be a prince, and so happy in that happiness as to be a beloved prince, and so in his private blessed as to have so excellent a wife and so over-excellent children - hath of late taken a course which yet makes him more spoken of than all these blessings. For, having made a journey to Delphos and safely returned, within short space he brake up his court and retired himself, his wife and children, into a certain forest hereby which he calleth his desert; wherein, besides a house appointed for stables and lodgings for certain persons of mean calling who do all household services, he hath builded two fine lodges. In the one of them himself remains with his younger daughter Philoclea - which was the cause they three were matched together in this picture - without having any other creature living in that lodge with him.
   ‘Which though it be strange, yet not strange as the course he hath taken with the princess Pamela whom he hath placed in the other lodge; but how think you accompanied? Truly with none other but one Dametas, the most arrant doltish clown that I think ever was without the privilege of a bauble, with his wife Miso and daughter Mopsa, in whom no wit can devise anything wherein they may pleasure her but to exercise her patience and to serve for a foil of her perfections. This loutish clown is such that you never saw so ill-favoured a vizor; his behaviour such that he is beyond the degree of ridiculous; and for his apparel, even as I would wish him- Miso his wife, so handsome a beldam that only her face and her splay-foot have made her accused for a witch; only one good point she hath, that she observes decorum, having a froward mind in a wretched body. Between these two personages (who never agreed in any humour, but in disagreeing^ is issued forth mistress Mopsa, a fit woman to participate of both their perfections: but because a pleasant fellow of my acquaintance set forth her praises in verse, I will only repeat them and spare mine own tongue, since she goes for a woman. The verses are these, which I have so often caused to be sung that I have them without book.
What length of verse can serve brave Mopsa’s good to show,
Whose virtues strange, and beauties such, as no man them may know?
Thus shrewdly burden’d then, how can my Muse escape?

The Gods must help, and precious things must serve to shew her shape:
Like great God Saturn fair, and like fair Venus chaste:
As smooth as Pan, as Juno mild, like Goddess Iris fast 
With Cupid she foresees, and goes God Vulcan’s pace:
And for a taste of all these gifts, she steals God Momus’ grace. 
Her forehead Jacinth-like, her cheeks of Opal hue,
Her twinkling eyes bedeck'd with Pearl, her Ups as Sapphire blue:
Her hair like Crapal stone; her mouth O heav’nly wide!
Her skin like burnished gold, her hands like silver ore untry’d. 
As for her parts unknown, which hidden sure are best:
Happy be they which well believe, and never seek the rest.
   ‘Now truly having made these descriptions unto you, methinks you should imagine that I rather feign some pleasant device than recount a truth, that a prince not banished from his own wits could possibly make so unworthy a choice. But truly, dear guest, so it is that princes (whose doings have been often smoothed with good success) think nothing so absurd which they cannot make honourable. The beginning of his credit was by the prince’s straying out of the way one time he hunted, where meeting this fellow and asking him the way, and so falling into other questions, he found some of his answers (as a dog sure, if he could speak, had wit enough to describe his kennel) not unsensible, and all uttered with such rudeness, which he interpreted plainness - though there be great difference between them - that Basilius, conceiving a sudden delight, took him to his court with apparent show of his good opinion: where the flattering courtier had no sooner taken the prince’s mind but that there were straight reasons to confirm the prince’s doing and shadows of virtues found for Dametas. His silence grew wit, his bluntness integrity, his beastly ignorance virtuous simplicity; and the prince (according to the nature of great persons, in love with what he had done himself) fancied that his weakness with his presence would much be mended. And so like a creature of his own making, he liked him more and more; and thus having first given him the office of principal herdsman, lastly, since he took this strange determination, he hath in a manner put the life of himself and his children into his hands. Which authority, like too great a sail for so small a boat, doth so oversway poor Dametas that, if before he was a good fool in a chamber, he might be allowed it now in a comedy; so as I doubt me (I fear me indeed) my master will in the end with his cost find that his office is not to make men but to use men as men are, no more than a horse will be taught to hunt, or an ass to manage. But in sooth I am afraid I have given your ears too great a surfeit with the gross discourses of that heavy piece of flesh. But the zealous grief I conceive to see so great an error in my lord hath made me bestow more words than I confess so base a subject deserveth.
   CHAPTER 4
   ‘Thus much now that I have told you is nothing more than in effect any Arcadian knows. But what moved him to this strange solitariness hath been imparted, as I think, but to one person living. Myself can conjecture, and indeed more than conjecture, by this accident that I will tell you. I have an only son, by name Cli- tophon, who is now absent, preparing for his own marriage, which I mean shortly shall be here celebrated. This son of mine, while the prince kept his court, was of his bed-chamber; now since the breaking up thereof returned home and showed me, among other things he had gathered, the copy which he had taken of a letter which, when the prince had read, he had laid in a window, presuming nobody durst look in his writings; but my son not only took a time to read it but to copy it. In truth I blamed Clitophon for the curiosity which made him break his duty in such a kind, whereby kings’ secrets are subject to be revealed; but since it was done, I was content to take so much profit as to know it. Now here is the letter that I ever since, for my good liking, have carried about me: which before I read unto you, I must tell you from whom it came. It is a nobleman of this country, named Philanax, appointed (by the prince) regent in this time of his retiring, and most worthy so to be; for there lives no man whose excellent wit more simply embraceth integrity, besides his unfeigned love to his master, wherein never yet any could make question saving whether he loved Basilius or the prince better: a rare temper, while most men either servilely yield to all appetites, or, with an obstinate austerity looking to that they fancy good, in effect neglect the prince’s person. This then being the man whom of all other (and most worthy) the prince chiefly loves, it should seern - for more than the letter I have not to guess by - that the prince upon his return from Delphos (Philanax then lying sick) had written unto him his determination rising, as evidently appears, upon some oracles he had there received: whereunto he wrote this answer:
   Philanax’  letter to Basilius
   Most redoubted and beloved prince, if as well it had pleased you at your going to Delphos, as now, to have used my humble service, both I should in better season and to better purpose have spoken, and you (if my speech had prevailed) should have been at this time, as no way more in danger, so much more in quietness. I would then have said that wisdom and virtue be the only destinies appointed to mall to follow, whence we ought to seek all our knowledge, since they be such guides as cannot fail; which, besides their inward comfort do lead so direct a way of proceeding as either prosperity must ensue, or, if the wickedness of the world should oppress it, it can never be said that evil happeneth to him who falls accompanied with virtue. I would then have said the heavenly powers to be reverenced and not searched into, and their mercies rather by prayers to be sought than their hidden counsels by curiosity. These kinds of sooth-sayings (since they have left us in ourselves sufficient guides) to be nothing but fancy, wherein there must either be vanity or infallibleness, and so either not to be respected, or not to be prevented. But since it is weakness too much to remember what should have been done, and that your commandment stretcheth to know what is to be done,  do, most dear Lord, with humble boldness say that the manner of your determination doth in no sort better please me than the cause of your going. These thirty years you have so governed this region that neither your subjects have wanted justice in you, nor you obedience in them; and your neighbours have found you so hurtlessly strong that they thought it better to rest in your friendship than to make new trial of your enmity. If this then have proceeded out of the good constitution of your state and out of a wise providence generally to prevent all those things which might encumber your happiness, why should you now seek new courses, since your own example comforts you to continue, and that it is to me most certain (though it please you not to tell me the very words of the oracle) that yet no destiny nor influence whatsoever can bring man’s wit to a higher point than wisdom and goodness? Why should you deprive yourself of government for fear of losing your government, like one that should kill himself for fear of death? Nay, rather, if this oracle be to be accounted of, arm up your courage the more against it, for who will stick to him that abandons himself? Let your subjects have you in their eyes. Let them see the benefits of your justice daily more and more, and so must they needs rather like of present sureties than uncertain changes. Lastly, whether your time call you to live or die, do both like a prince.
   Now for your second resolution, which is to suffer no worthy prince to be a suitor to either of your daughters, but while you live to keep them both unmarried and, as it were, to kill the joy of posterity which in your time you may enjoy, moved perchance by a misunderstood oracle: what shall I say, if the affection of a father to his own children cannot plead sufficiently against such fancies? Once certain it is, the God which is God of nature doth never teach unnaturalness; and even the same mind hold I touching your banishing them from company, lest I know not w'hat strange loves should follow. Certainly, Sir, in my ladies, your daughters, nature promiseth nothing but goodness, and their education by your fatherly care hath been hitherto such as hath been most fit to restrain all evil, giving their minds virtuous delights, and not grieving them for want of well- ruled liberty. Now to fall to a sudden straitening them, what can it do but argue suspicion - a thing no more unpleasant than unsure for the preserving of virtue. Leave women’s minds, the most untamed that way of any. See whether any cage can please a bird, or whether a dog grow not fiercer with tying. What doth jealousy but stir up the mind to think what it is from which they are restrained? For they are treasures or things of great delight which men use to hide for the aptness they have to catch men’s fancies; and the thoughts once awaked to that, harder sure it is to keep those thoughts from accomplishment than it had been before to have kept the mind (which being the chief part, by this means is defiled) from thinking. Lastly, for the recommending of so principal a charge of the princess Pamela (whose mind goes beyond the governing of many thousands such) to such a person as Dametas is (besides that the thing in itself is strange) it comes of a very evil ground that ignorance should be the mother of faithfulness. Oh no, he cannot be good that knows not why he is good, but stands so far good as his fortune may keep him unassayed; but coming once to that, his rude simplicity is either easily changed or easily deceived; and so grows that to be the last excuse of his fault which seemed to have been the first foundation of his faith. Thus far hath your commandment and my zeal drawn me; which I, like a man in a valley that may discern hills, or like a poor passenger that may spy a rock, so humbly submit to your gracious consideration, beseeching you again to stand wholly upon your own virtue as the surest way to maintain you in that you are, and to avoid any evil which may be imagined.
   ‘By the contents of this letter you may perceive that the cause of all hath been the vanity which possesseth many who (making a perpetual mansion of this poor baiting-place of man’s life) are desirous to know the certainty of things to come, wherein there is nothing so certain as our continual uncertainty. But what in particular points the oracle was, in faith I know not, neither - as you may see by one place of Philanax’s letter - he himself distinctly knew. But this experience shews us that Basilius’ judgement, corrupted with a prince’s fortune, hath rather heard than followed the wise (as I take it) counsel of Philanax. For having left the stern of his government, with much amazement to the people, among whom many strange bruits are received for current, and with some appearance of danger in respect of the valiant Am- phialus his nephew, and much envy in the ambitious number of the nobility against Philanax to see Philanax so advanced - though (to speak simply) he deserve more than as many of us as there be in Arcadia - the prince himself hath hidden his head in such sort as I told you, not sticking plainly to confess that he means not while he breathes that his daughters shall have any husband, but keep them thus solitary with him: where he gives no other body leave to visit him at any time but a certain priest, who being excellent in poetry, he makes him write out such things as he best likes - he being no less delightful in conversation than needful for devotion - and about twenty specified shepherds in whom (some for exercises and some for eclogues) he taketh greater recreation.
   ‘And now you know as much as myself; wherein if I have held you over-long, lay hardly the fault upon my old age, which in the very disposition of it is talkative: whether it be,' said he smiling, ‘that nature loves to exercise that part most which is least decayed, and that is our tongue; or that knowledge being the only thing whereof we poor old men can brag, we cannot make it known but by utterance; or that mankind, by all means seeking to eternize himself so much the more as he is near his end, doth it not only by the children that come of him, but by speeches and writings recommended to the memory of hearers and readers. And yet thus much I will say for myself, that I have not laid these matters either so openly or largely to any as yourself; so much, if I much fail not, do I see in you which makes me both love and trust you.’
   ‘Never may he be old,’ answered Palladius, ‘that doth not reverence that age whose heaviness, if it weigh down the frail and fleshly balance, it as much lifts up the noble and spiritual part; and well might you have alleged another reason, that their wisdom makes them willing to profit others. And that have I received of you, never to be forgotten but with ungratefulness. But among many strange conceits you told me, which have shewed effects in your prince, truly even the last, that he should conceive such pleasure in shepherds’ discourses, would not seem the least unto me, saving that you told me at the first that this country is notable in those wits, and that indeed myself, having been brought not only to this place but to my life by Strephon and Claius, in their conference found wits as might better become such shepherds as Homer speaks of, that be governors of peoples, than such senators who hold their council in a sheep-cote.'
   ‘For them two,’ said Kalander, ‘especially Claius, they are beyond the rest by so much as learning commonly doth add to nature: for, having neglected their wealth in respect of their knowledge, they have not so much impaired the meaner as they bettered the better. Which all notwithstanding, it is a sport to hear how they impute to love, which hath indued their thoughts, say they, with such a strength. But certainly all the people of this country, from high to low, is given to those sports of the wit, so as you would wonder to hear how soon even children will begin to versify. Once, ordinary it is among the meanest sort to make songs and dialogues in metre, either love whetting their brain, or long peace having begun it, example and emulation amending it. Not so much, but the clown Dametas will stumble sometimes upon some songs that might become a better brain: but no sort of people so excellent in that kind as the pastors, for their living standing but upon the looking to their beasts, they have ease, the nurse of poetry. Neither are our shepherds such as, I hear, they be in other countries, but they are the very owners of the sheep to which either themselves look, or their children give daily attendance. And then truly, it would delight you under some tree or by some river’s side, when two or three of them meet together, to hear their rural muse, how prettily it will deliver out sometimes joys, sometimes lamentations, sometimes challengings one of the other, sometimes under hidden forms uttering such matters as otherwise they durst not deal with. Then have they most commonly one who judgeth the prize to the best doer, of which they are no less glad than great princes are of triumphs; and his part is to set down in WrTiting all that is said, save that it may be his pen with more leisure doth polish the rudeness of an unthought-on song.
   Now the choice of all, as you may well think, either for goodness of voice or pleasantness of wit, the prince hath: among whom also there are two or three strangers, whom inw?rd melancholies having made weary of the world’s eyes, have come to spend their lives among the country people of Arcadia, and their conversation being well approved, the prince vouchsafeth them his presence, and not only by looking on but by great courtesy and liberality animates the shepherds the more exquisitely to labour for his good liking. So that there is no cause to blame the prince for sometimes hearing them; the blame-worthiness is that to hear them he rather goes to solitariness than makes them come to company. Neither do I accuse my master for advancing a country-man, as Dametas is, since God forbid but where worthiness is - as truly it is among divers of that fellowship - any outward lowness should hinder the highest rising; but that he would needs make election of one the baseness of whose mind is such that it sinks a thousand degrees lower than the basest body could carry the most base fortune: which although it might be answered for the prince that it is rather a trust he hath in his simple plainness than any great advancement, being but chief herdman, yet all honest hearts feel that the trust of their lord goes beyond all advancement But I am ever too long upon him when he crosseth the way of my speech, and by the shadow of yonder tower I see it is a fitter time with our suppsr to pay the duties we owe to our stomachs than to break the air with my idle discourses: and more wit I might have learned of Homer, whom even now you mentioned, who never entertained either guests or hosts with long speeches till the mouth of hunger were thoroughly stopped.’
   So withal he rose, leading Palladius through the garden again to the parlour where they used to sup; Palladius assuring him he had already been more fed to his liking than he could be by the skilfullest trencher-men of Media.
   CHAPTER 5
   But being come to the supping-place, one of Kalander’s servants rounded in his ear, at which his colour changing, he retired himself into his chamber, commanding his men diligendy to wait upon Palladius, and to excuse his absence with some necessary business he had presendy to dispatch: which they accordingly did, for some few days forcing themselves to let no change appear: but, though they framed their countenances never so cunningly, Palladius perceived there was some ill-pleasing accident fallen out. Whereupon, being again set alone at supper, he called to the steward and desired him to tell him the matter of his sudden alteration: who, after some trifling excuses, in the end confessed unto him that his master had received news that his son, before the day of his near marriage, chanced to be at a batlle which was to be fought between the gentlemen of Lacedaemon and the Helots, who winning the victory, he was there made prisoner going to deliver a friend of his, taken prisoner by the Helots: that the poor young gentleman had offered great ransom for his life; but that the hate those peasants conceived against all gentlemen was such that every hour he was to look for nothing but some cruel death, which hitherto had only been delayed by the captain’s vehement dealing for him, who seemed to have a heart of more manly pity than the rest. Which loss had stricken the old gentleman with such sorrow, as if abundance of tears did not seem sufficiently to witness it, he was alone retired, tearing his beard and hair and cursing his old age that had not made his grave to stop his ears from such advertisements: but that his faithful servants had written in his name to all his friends, followers, and tenants (Philanax the governor refusing to deal in it, as a private cause, but yet giving leave to seek their best redress so as they wronged not the state of Lacedaemon) of whom there were now gathered upon the frontiers good forces that he was sure would spend their lives by any way to redeem or revenge Clitophon.
   ‘Now Sir,’ said he, ‘this is my master’s nature, though his grief be such as to live is a grief unto him and that even his reason is darkened with sorrow, yet the laws of hospitality (long and holily observed by him) gave still such a sway to his proceeding that he will no way suffer the stranger lodged under his roof to receive, as it were, any infection of his anguish, especially you, towards whom I know not whether his love or admiration be greater.’
   But Palladius could scarce hear out his tale with patience, so was his heart torn in pieces with compassion of the case, liking of Kalander’s noble behaviour, kindness for his respect to him-ward, and desire to find some remedy, besides the image of his dearest friend Daiphantus, whom he judged to suffer either a like or a worse fortune. Therefore rising from the board, he desired the steward to tell him particularly the ground and event of this accident, because by knowledge of many circumstances there might perhaps some way of help be opened. Whereunto the steward easily in this sort condescended.
   ‘My Lord,’ said he, ‘when our good king Basilius, with better success than expectation, took to wife even in his more than decaying years the fair young princess Gynecia, there came with her a young lord, cousin german to herself, named Argalus, led hither partly with the love and honour of his noble kinswoman, partly with the humour of youth which ever thinks that good whose goodness he sees not. And in this court he received so good increase of knowledge, that after some years spent he so manifested a most virtuous mind in all his actions that Arcadia gloried such a plant was transported unto them, being a gentleman in deed most rarely accomplished, excellently learned, but without all vain glory; friendly without factiousness; valiant, so as for my part I think the earth hath no man that hath done more heroical acts than he, howsoever now of late the fame flies of the two princes of Thessalia and Macedon, and hath long done of our noble prince Amphialus, who indeed in our parts is only accounted likely to match him. But I say for my part, I think no man for valour of mind and ability of body to be preferred, if equalled to Argalus; and yet so valiant as he never durst do anybody injury: in behaviour, some will say, ever sad, surely sober, and somewhat given to musing, but never uncourteous; his word ever led by his thought and followed by his deed: rather liberal than magnificent, though the one wanted not and the other had ever good choice of the receiver. In sum (for I perceive I shall easily take a great draught of his praises, whom both I and all this country love so well) such a man was - and I hope is - Argalus as hardly the nicest eye can find a spot in, if the over-vehement constancy of yet spotless affection may not in hard-wrested constructions be counted a spot: which in this manner began that work in him which hath made both him, and itself in him, over all this country famous.
   My master’s son Clitophon (whose loss gives the cause to this discourse, and yet gives me cause to begin with Argalus, since his loss proceeds from Argalus) being a young gentleman as of great birth, being our king’s sister's son, so truly of good nature and one that can see good and love it, haunted more the company of this worthy Argalus than of any other; so as if there were not a friendship (which is so rare as it is to be doubted whether it be a thing in deed or but a word) at least there was such a liking and friendliness as hath brought forth the effects which you shall hear. About two years since, it so fell out that he brought him to a great lady’s house, sister to my master, who had with her her only daughter, the fair Parthenia; fair indeed (fame, I think, itself daring not to call any fairer, if it be not Helena, queen of Corinth, and the two incomparable sisters of Arcadia) and that which made her fairness much the fairer was that it was but a fair ambassador of a most fair mind; full of wit, and a wit which delighted more to judge itself than to shew itself: her speech being as rare as precious; her silence without sullenness; her modesty without affectation; her shamefastness without ignorance: in sum, one that to praise well, one must first set down with himself what it is to be excellent, for so she is.
   ‘I think you think that these perfections, meeting, could not choose but find one another and delight in that they found; for likeness of manners is likely in reason to draw liking with affection: men’s actions do not always cross with reason. To be short, it did so indeed. They loved, although for a while the fire thereof (hope's wings being cut off) were blown by the bellows of despair, upon this occasion:
   ‘There had been a good while before, and so continued, a suitor to this same lady, a great noble man, though of Laconia yet near neighbour to Parthenia's mother, named Demagoras; a man mighty in riches and power and proud thereof, stubbornly stout, loving nobody but himself and, for his own delight’s sake, Parthenia: and pursuing vehemently his desire, his riches had so gilded over all his other imperfections that the old lady, though contrary to my lord her brother's mind, had given her consent; and using a mother’s authority upon her fair danghter had made her yield thereunto, not because she liked her choice but because her obedient mind had not yet taken upon it to make choice. And the day of their assurance drew near, when my young lord Clitophon brought this noble Argalus, perchance principally to see so rare a sight, as Parthenia by all well-judging eyes was judged.
   ‘But though few days were before the time of assurance appointed, yet love, that saw he had a great journey to make in short time, hasted so himself that before her word could tie her to Demagoras, her heart hath vowed her to Argalus with so grateful a receipt in mutual affection that if she desired above all things to have Argalus, Argalus feared nothing but to miss Parthenia. And now Parthenia had learned both liking and misliking, loving and loathing, and out of passion began to take the authority of judgement; insomuch that when the time came that Demagoras, full of proud joy, thought to receive the gift of herself, she, with words of resolute refusal though with tears showing she was sorry she must refuse, assured her mother she would first be bedded in her grave than wedded to Demagoras. The change was no more strange than unpleasant to the mother who, being determinately (lest I should say of a great lady, wilfully) bent to marry her to Demagoras, tried all ways which a witty and hard-hearted mother could use upon so humble a daughter in whom the only resisting power was love. But the more she assaulted, the more she taught Parthenia to defend; and the more Parthenia defended, the more she made her mother obstinate in the assault: who at length finding that Argalus standing between them was it that most eclipsed her affection from shining upon Demagoras, she sought all means how to remove him, so much the more as he manifested himself an unremovable suitor to her daughter first, by employing him in as many dangerous enterprises as ever the evil stepmother Juno recommended to the famous Hercules. But the more his virtue was tried, the more pure it grew, while all the things she did to overthrow him did set him up upon the height of honour enough to have moved her heart, especially to a man every way so worthy as Argalus: but she struggling against all reason, because she would have her will and shew her authority in matching her with Demagoras, the more virtuous Argalus was, the more she hated him, thinking herself conquered in his conquests, and therefore still employing him in more and more dangerous attempts. In the meanwhile she used all extremities possible upon her fair daughter to make her give over herself to her direction. But it was hard to judge whether he in doing or she in suffering shewed greater constancy of affection; for, as to Argalus the world sooner wanted occasions than he valour to go through them, so to Parthenia malice sooner ceased than her unchanged patience. Lastly, by treasons Demagoras and she would have made away with Argalus, but he with providence and courage so passed over all that the mother took such a spiteful grief at it that her heart brake withal, and she died.
   ‘But then Demagoras, assuring himself that now Parthenia was her own she would never be his, and receiving as much by her own determinate answer; not more desiring his own happiness than envying Argalus, whom he saw with narrow eyes even ready to enjoy the perfection of his desires; strengthening his conceit with all the mischievous counsels which disdained love and envious Pride could give unto him, the wicked wretch (taking a time that Argalus was gone to his country to fetch some of his principal friends to honour the marriage which Parthenia had most joyfully consented unto) the wicked Demagoras, I say, desiring to speak with her, with unmerciful force (her weak arms in vain resisting) rubbed all over her face a most horrible poison, the effect whereof was such that never leper looked more ugly than she did: which done, having his men and horses ready, departed away in spite of her servants, as ready to revenge as they could be in such an unexpected mischief. But the abominableness of this fact being come to my L. Kalander, he made such means, both by our king’s intercession and his own, that by the king and senate of Lacedaemon, Demagoras was upon pain of death banished the country: who, hating the punishment where he should have hated the fault, joined himself, with all the powers he could make, unto the Helots, lately in rebellion against that state: and they, glad to have a man of such authority among them, made him their general, and under him have committed divers the most outrageous villanies that a base multitude full of desperate revenge can imagine.
   ‘But within a while after this pitiful fact committed upon Parthenia, Argalus returned, poor Gentleman, having her fair image in his heart, and already promising his eyes the uttermost of his felicity when they (nobody else daring to tell it him) were the first messengers to themselves of their own misfortune. I mean rot to move passions with telling you the grief of both when he knew her, for at first he did not; nor at first knowledge could possibly have virtue’s aid so ready as not even weakly to lament the loss of such a jewel, so much the more as that skilful men in that art assured it was unrecoverable. But within a while, truth of love (which still held the first face in his memory) a virtuous constancy', and even a delight to be constant, faith given, and inward worthiness shining through the foulest mists, took so full hold of the noble Argalus, that not only in such comfort which witty arguments may bestow upon adversity, but even with the most abundant kindness that an eye-ravished lover can express, he laboured both to drive the extremity of sorrow from her and to hasten the celebration of their marriage: whereunto he un- feignedly shewed himself no less cheerfully earnest than if she had never been disinherited of that goodly portion which nature had so liberally bequeathed unto her; and for that cause deferred his intended revenge upon Demagoras, because he might continually be in her presence, shewing more humble serviceableness and joy to content her than ever before.
   ‘But as he gave this rare example (not to be hoped for of any other but of another Argalus) so of the other side, she took as strange a course in affection; for where she desired to enjoy him more than to live, yet did she overthrow both her own desire and his and in no sort would yield to marry him: with a strange encounter of love’s affects and effects; that he by an affection sprung from excessive beauty should delight in horrible foulness, and she of a vehement desire to have him should kindly build a resolution never to have him; for truth is, that so in heart she loved him as she could not find in her heart he should be tied to what was unworthy of his presence.
   ‘Truly, Sir, a very good orator might have a fair field to use eloquence in, if he did but only repeat the lamentable and truly affectionated speeches, while he conjured her by remembrance of her affection and true oaths of his own affection not to make him so unhappy as to think he had not only lost her face but her heart; that her face, when it was fairest, had been but as a marshal to lodge the love of her in his mind, which now was so well placed as it needed no further help of any outward harbinger; beseeching her, even with tears, to know that his love was not so superficial as to go no further than the skin, which yet now to him was most fair since it was hers: how could he be so ungrateful as to love her the less for that which she had only received for his sake; that he never beheld it, but therein he saw the loveliness of her love towards him; protesting unto her that he would never take joy of his life if he might not enjoy her for whom principally he was glad he had life. But (as I heard by one that overheard them) she, wringing him by the hand, made no other answer but this:
   “My Lord,” said she, “God knows I love you. If I were princess of the whole world and had, withal, all the blessings that ever the world brought forth, I should not make delay to lay myself and them under your feet; or if I had continued but as I was, though, I must confess, far unworthy of you, yet would I (with too great a joy for my heart to think of) have accepted your vouchsafing me to be yours, and with faith and obedience would have supplied all other defects. But first let me be so much more miserable than I am ere I match Argalus to such a Parthenia. Live happy, dear Argalus, I give you full liberty, and I beseech you take it; and I assure you I shall rejoice (whatsoever become of me) to see you so coupled as may be fit both for your honour and satisfaction.” With that she burst out crying and weeping, not able longer to contain herself from blaming her fortune and wishing her own death.
   ‘But Argalus, with a most heavy heart still pursuing his desire, she fixed of mind to avoid further intreaty, and to fly all company which, even of him, grew unpleasant unto her; one night she stole away: but whither as yet is unknown or indeed, what is become of her.
   ‘Argalus sought her long, and in many places; at length (despairing to find her, and the more he despaired, the more enraged) weary of his life, but first determining to be revenged of Demagoras, he went alone disguised into the chief town held by the Helots, where coming into his presence, guarded about by many of his soldiers, he could delay his firry no longer for a fitter time, but setting upon him, in despite of a great many that helped him, gave him divers mortal wounds, and himself (no question) had been there presently murdered, but that Demagoras himself desired he might be kept alive, perchance with intention to feed his own eyes with some cruel execution to be laid upon him. But death came sooner than he looked for, yet having had leisure to appoint his successor, a young man not long before delivered out of the prison of the king of Lacedaemon, where he should have suffered death for having slain the king’s nephew: but him he named, who at that time was absent making inroads upon the Lacedaemonians. But being returned, the rest of the Helots, for the great liking they conceived of that young man (especially because they had none among themselves to whom the others would yield) were content to follow Demagoras’ appointment And well hath it succeeded with them, he having since done things beyond the hope of the youngest heads; of whom I speak the rather because he hath hitherto preserved Argalus alive, under pretence to have him publicly and with exquisite torments executed after the end of these wars, of which they hope for a soon and prosperous issue.
   ‘And he hath likewise hitherto kept my young lord Clitophon alive, who, to redeem his friend, went with certain other noble men of Laconia and forces gathered by them, to besiege this young and new successor: but he issuing out, to the wonder of all men defeated die Laconians, slew many of the noblemen, and took Clitophon prisoner, whom with much ado he keepeth alive, the Helots being villainously cruel But he tempereth them so, sometimes by following their humour, sometimes by striving with it, that hitherto he hath saved both their lives, but in different estates; Argalus being kept in a close and hard prison, Clitophon at some liberty. And now, Sir, though (to say the truth) we can promise ourselves little of their safeties while they are in the Helots’ hands, I have delivered all I understand touching the loss of my lord s son, and the cause thereof: which though it was not necessary to Clitophon’s case to be so particularly old, yet the strangeness of it made me think it would not be unpleasant unto you.’
   CHAPTER 6
   Palladius thanked him greatly for it, being even passionately delighted with hearing so strange an accident of a knight so famous over the world as Argalus, with whom he had himself a long desire to meet: so had fame poured a noble emulation in him towards him.
   But then, well bethinking himself, he called for armour, desiring them to provide him of horse and guide, and armed all saving the head, he went up to Kalander, whom he found lying upon the ground, having ever since banished both sleep and food as enemies to the mourning which passion persuaded him was reasonable. But Palladius raised him up, saying unto him: 'No more, no more of this, my L. Kalander: let us labour to find, before we lament the loss. You know myself miss one who, though he be not my son, I would disdain the favour of life after him: but while there is a hope left, let not the weakness of sorrow make the strength of it languish. Take comfort, and good success will follow.'
   And with those words, comfort seemed to lighten in his eyes, and that in his face and gesture was painted victory. Once, Ka-lander’s spirits were so revived withal that, receiving some sustenance and taking a little rest, he armed himself and those few of his servants he had left unsent, and so himself guided Palladius to the place upon the frontiers where already there were assembled between three and four thousand men; all well disposed for Ka-lander’s sake to abide any peril, but like men disused with a long peace, more determinate to do than skilful how to do: lusty bodies, and brave armours; with such courage as rather grew of despising their enemies, whom they knew not, than of any confidence for anything which in themselves they knew; but neither cunning use of their weapons nor art showed in their marching or encamping. Which Palladius soon perceiving, he desired to understand (as much as could be delivered unto him) the estate of the Helots.
   And he was answered by a man well acquainted with the affairs of Laconia, that they were a kind of people who, having been of old freemen and possessioners, the Lacedaemonians had conquered them and laid not only tribute, but bondage upon them; which they had long borne, till of late, the Lacedaemonians through greediness growing more heavy than they could bear, and through contempt less careful how to make them bear, they had With a general consent (rather springing by the generalness of the cause than of any artificial practice) set themselves in arms, and whetting their courage with revenge, and grounding their resolution upon despair, they had proceeded with unlooked-for success, having already taken divers towns and castles, with the slaughter of many of the gentry, for whom no sex nor age could be accepted for an excuse. And that although at the first they had fought rather with beastly fury than any soldierly discipline, practice had now made them comparable to the best of the Lacedaemonians, and more of late than ever; by reason, first of Demagoras, a great lord, who had made himself of their party, and since his death, of another captain they had gotten, who had brought up their ignorance and brought down their fury to such a mean of good government, and withal led them so valorously that (besides the time wherein Clitophon was taken) they had the better in some other great conflicts: in such wise that the estate of Lacedaemon had sent unto them, offering peace with most reasonable and honourable conditions. Palladius having gotten this general knowledge of the party against whom, as he had already of the party for whom, he was to fight, he went to Kalander and told him plainly that by plain force there was small appearance of helping Clitophon; but some device was to be taken in hand wherein no less discretion than valour was to be used.
   Whereupon, the counsel of the chief men was called, and at last this way Palladius (who by some experience, but specially by reading histories, was acquainted with stratagems) invented, and was by all the rest approved: that all the men there should dress themselves like the poorest sort of the people in Arcadia, having no banners, but bloody shirts hanged upon long staves, with some bad bag-pipes instead of drum and fife: their armour they should, as well as might be, cover, or at least make them look so rustily and ill-favouredly as might well become such wearers; and this the whole number should do, saving two hundred of the best chosen gentlemen for courage and strength, whereof Palladius himself would be one, who should have their arms chained, and be put in carts like prisoners.
   This being performed according to the agreement, they marched on towards the town of Cardamila where Clitophon was captive; and being come two hours before sunset within view of the walls, the Helots already descrying their number and beginning to sound the alarm, they sent a cunning fellow (so much the cunninger as that he could mask it under rudeness) who, with such a kind of rhetoric as weeded out all flowers of rhetoric, delivered 'into the Helots assembled together that they were country-people of Arcadia, no less oppressed by their lords and no less desirous of liberty than they, and therefore had put themselves in the field and had already, besides a great number slain, taken nine or ten score gentlemen prisoners whom they had there well and fast chained. Now because they had no strong retiring place in Arcadia and Were not yet of number enough to keep the field against their prince’s forces, they were come to them for succour; knowing that daily more and more of their quality would flock unto them, but that in the meantime, lest their prince should pursue them or the Lacedaemonian king and nobility for the likeness of the cause fall upon them, they desired that if there were not room enough for them in the town, that yet they might encamp under the walls, and for surety have their prisoners (who were such men as were ever able to make their peace) kept within the town.
   The Helots made but a short consultation, being glad that their contagion had spread itself into Arcadia, and making account that if the peace did not fall out between them and their king, that it was the best way to set fire in all the parts of Greece; besides their greediness to have so many gentlemen in their hands in whose ransoms they already meant to have a share; to which haste of concluding, two things well helped: the one, that their captain, with the wisest of them, was at that time absent about confirming or breaking the peace with the state of Lacedaemon: the second, that over-many good fortunes began to breed a proud recklessness in them. Therefore sending to view the camp, and finding that by their speech they were Arcadians, with whom they had had no war, never suspecting a private man’s credit could have gathered such a force, and that all other tokens witnessed them to be of the lowest calling (besides the chains upon the gentlemen) they granted not only leave for the prisoners but for some others of the company, and to all, that they might harbour under the walls. So opened they the gates and received in the carts; which being done, and Palladius seeing fit time, he gave the sign, and shaking off their chains (which were made with such art that though they seemed most strong and fast, he that ware them might easily loose them) drew their swords hidden in the carts, and so setting upon the ward, made them to fly either from the place or from their bodies, and so give entry to all the force of the Arcadians before the Helots could make any head to resist them.
   But the Helots, being men hardened against dangers, gathered as well as they could together in the market-place, and thence would have given a shrewd welcome to the Arcadians but that Palladius (blaming those that were slow, heartening them that were forward, but especially with his own example leading them) made such an impression into the squadron of the Helots that at first the great body of them beginning to shake and stagger, at length every particular body recommended the protection of his life to his feet. Then Kalander cried to go to the prison where he thought his son was; but Palladius wished him, first scouring the streets, to house all the Helots and make themselves masters of the gates.
   But ere that could be accomplished, the Helots had gotten new heart, and with divers sorts of shot, from corners of streets and house-windows, galled them; which courage was come unto them by the return of their captain, who, though he brought not many with him (having dispersed most of his companies to other of his holds) yet meeting a great number running out of the gate, not yet possessed by the Arcadians, he made them turn face, and with banners displayed, his trumpet gave the loudest testimony he could of his return: which once heard, the rest of the Helots, which were otherwise scattered, bent thitherward with a new life of resolution, as if their captain had been a root out of which as into branches their courage had sprung. Then began the fight to grow most sharp and the encounters of more cruel obstinacy: the Arcadians fighting to keep that they had won, the Helots to recover what they had lost; the Arcadians as in an unknown place, having no succour but in their hands; the Helots as in their own place, fighting for their lives, wives and children. There was victory and courage against revenge and despair, safety of both sides being no otherwise to be gotten but by destruction.
   At length, the left wing of the Arcadians began to lose ground; which Palladius feeling, he straight thrust himself with his choice band against the throng that oppressed them, with such an overflowing of valour that the captain of the Helots (whose eyes soon judged of that wherewith themselves w'ere governed) saw that he alone was worth all the rest of the Arcadians: which he so wondered at, that it was hard to say whether lie more liked his doings, or misliked the effects of his doings. But determining that upon that cast the game lay, and disdaining to fight with any other, sought only to join with him: which mind was no less in Palladius, having easily marked that he was as the first mover of all the other hands. And so their thoughts meeting in one point, they consented (though not agreed) to try each other’s fortune: and so drawing themselves to be the uttermost of the one side, they began a combat which was so much inferior to the battle in noise and number as it was surpassing it in bravery of fighting, and, as it were, delightful terribleness. Their courage was guided with skill, and their skill was armed with courage; neither did their hardiness darken their wit, nor their wit cool their hardiness: both valiant, as men despising death; both confident, as unwonted to be overcome, yet doubtful by their present feeling, and respectful by what they had already seen: their feet steady, their hands diligent, their eyes watchful, and their hearts resolute. The parts either not armed or weakly armed were well known, and according to the knowledge should have been sharply visited but that the answer was as quick as the objection. Yet some lighting, the smart bred rage and the rage bred smart again; till both sides beginning to wax faint, and rather desirous to die accompanied than hopeful to live victorious, the captain of the Helots with a blow whose violence grew of fury not of strength, or of strength proceeding of fury, struck Palladius upon the side of the head that he reeled astonished; and withal the helmet fell off, he remaining bare-headed, but other of the Arcadians were ready to shield him from any harm might rise of that nakedness.
   But little needed it, for his chief enemy, instead of pursuing that advantage, kneeled down, offering to deliver the pommel of his sword in token of yielding; withal speaking aloud unto him that he thought it more liberty to be his prisoner than any other’s general. Palladius standing upon himself and misdoubting some craft, and the Helots that were next their captain, wavering between looking for some stratagem or fearing treason:
   ‘What,’ said the captain, ‘hath Palladius forgotten the voice of Daiphantus?’
   By that watch-word Palladius knew' that it was his only friend Pyrocles whom he had lost upon the sea, and therefore both, most full of wonder so to be met if they had not been fuller of joy than wonder, caused the retreat to be sounded, Daiphantus by authority, and Palladius by persuasion: to which helped well the little advantage that was of either side, and that of the Helots’ party their captain’s behaviour had made as many amazed as saw' or heard of it, and of the Arcadian side the good old Kalander, striving more than his old age could achieve, was newly taken prisoner. But indeed the chief parter of the fray was the night which with her black arms pulled their malicious sights one from the other. But he that took Kalander meant nothing less than to save him, but only so long as the captain might learn the enemies' secrets; towards whom he led the old gentelman, when he caused the retreat to be sounded, looking for no other delivery from that captivity but by the painful taking away of all pain, when whom should he see next to the captain (with good tokens how valiantly he had fought that day against the Arcadians) but his son Clitophon!
   But now the captain had caused all the principal Helots to be assembled, as well to deliberate what they had to do as to receive a message from the Arcadians; among whom Palladius virtue (besides the love Kalander bare him) having gotten principal authority, he had persuaded them to seek rather by parley to recover the father and the son than by the sword; since the goodness of the captain assured him that way to speed, and his value (wherewith he was of old acquainted) made him think any other way dangerous. This therefore was done in orderly manner, giving them to understand that as they came but to deliver Clitophon, so offering to leave the footing they already had in the town, to go away without any further hurt, so as they might have the father and the son without ransom delivered.
   Which conditions being heard and conceived by the Helots, Daiphantus persuaded them without delay to accept them. Tor first,’ said he, ‘since the strife is within our own home, if you lose, you lose all that in this life can be dear unto you: if you win, it will be a bloody victory with no profit but the flattering in ourselves that same bad humour of revenge. Besides, it is like to stir Arcadia upon us, which now, by using these persons well, may be brought to some amity. Lastly, but especially, lest the king and nobility of Laconia, with whom now we have made a perfect peace, should hope by occasion of this quarrel to join the Arcadians with them, and so break off the profitable agreement already concluded. In sum, as in all deliberations, weighing the profit of the good success with the harm of the evil success, you shall find this way most safe and honourable.'
   The Helots, as much moved by his authority as persuaded by his reasons, were content therewith. Whereupon Palladius took order that the Arcadians should presently march out of the town, taking with them their prisoners, while the night with mutual diffidence might keep them quiet, and ere day came they might be well on of their way, and so avoid those accidents which in late enemies a look, a word, or a particular man’s quarrel might engender. This being on both sides concluded on, Kalander and Clitophon, who now with infinite joy did know each other, came to kiss the hands and feet of Daiphantus: Clitophon telling his father how Daiphantus, not without danger to himself, had preserved him from the furious malice of the Helots; and even that day going to conclude the peace, lest in his absence he might receive some hurt, he had taken him in his company and given him armour, upon promise he should take the part of the Helots; which he had in this fight performed, little knowing that it was against his father;‘But,'said Clitophon,‘here is he who(as a father) hath new-begotten me and (as a god) hath saved me from many deaths which already laid hold on me,' which Kalander with tears of joy acknowledged (besides his own deliverance) only his benefit But Daiphantus, who loved doing well for itself and not for thanks, brake off those ceremonies, desiring to know how Palladius - for so he called Musidorus - was come into that company, and what his present estate was; whereof receiving a brief declaration of Kalander, he sent him word by Clitophon that he should not as now come unto him, because he held himself not so sure a master of the Helots’ minds that he would adventure him in their power, who was so well known with an unfriendly acquaintance; but that he desired him to return with Kalander, whither also he within few days, having dispatched himself of the Helots, would repair. Kalander would need kiss his hand again for that promise, protesting he would esteem his house more blessed than a temple of the gods, if it had once received him. And then desiring pardon for Argalus, Daiphantus assured them that he would die but he would bring him (though till then kept in close prison, indeed for his safety, the Helots being so animated against him as else he could not have lived) and so taking their leave of him, Kalander, Clitophon, Palladius, and the rest of the Arcadians swearing that they would no further in any sort molest the Helots, they straightway marched out of the town, carrying both their dead and wounded bodies with them; and by morning were already within the limits of Arcadia.
   CHAPTER 7
   The Helots, of the other side, shutting their gates, gave themselves to bury their dead, to cure their wounds and rest their wearied bodies; till, the next day bestowing the cheerful use of the light upon them, Daiphantus, making a general convocation, spake unto them in this manner:
   ‘We are first,’ said he, ‘to thank the gods that, further than we had either cause to hope or reason to imagine, have delivered us out of this gulf of danger wherein we were already swallowed. For all being lost, had they not directed my return so just as they did, it had been too late to recover that which, being had, we could not keep. And had I not happened to know one of the principal men among them, by which means the truce began between us, you may easily conceive what little reason we have to think but that either by some supply out of Arcadia, or from the nobility of this country (who would have made fruits of wisdom grow out of this occasion) we should have had our power turned to ruin, our pride to repentance and sorrow. But now the storm as it fell, so it ceased; and the error committed, in retaining Clitophon more hardly than his age or quarrel deserved, becomes a sharply learned experience, to use in other times more moderation.
   ‘Now have I to deliver unto you the conclusion between the kings, with the nobility of Lacedaemon, and you; which is in all points as ourselves desired, as well for that you would have granted as for the assurance of what is granted. The towns and forts you presently have are still left unto you, to be kept either with or without garrison, so as you alter not the laws of the country, and pay such duties as the rest of the Laconians do. Yourselves are made by public decree free men, and so capable both to give and receive voice in election of magistrates. The distinction of names between Helots and Lacedaemonians to be quite taken away, and all indifferently to enjoy both names and privileges of Laconians. Your children to be brought up with theirs in the Spartan discipline: and so you, framing yourselves to be good members of that estate, to be hereafter fellows and no longer servants.
   ‘Which conditions you see carry in themselves no more contention than assurance; for this is not a peace which is made with them, but this a peace by which you are made of them. Lastly a forgetfulness decreed of all what is past, they showing themselves glad to have so valiant men as you are joined with them, so that you are to take minds of peace, since the cause of war is finished; and as you hated them before like oppressors, so now to love them as brothers; to take care of their estate because it is yours, and to labour by virtuous doing that the posterity may not repent your joining. But now one article only they stood upon, which in the end I with your commissioners have agreed unto, that I should no more tarry here; mistaking perchance my humour, and thinking me as seditious as I am young; or else it is the king Amiclas’ procuring, in respect that it was my ill hap to kill his nephew Eurileon; but howsoever it be, I have condescended/
   ‘But so will not we/ cried almost the whole assembly, counselling one another rather to try the uttermost event than to lose him by whom they had been victorious. But he, as well with general orations as particular dealing with the men of most credit, made them thoroughly see how necessary it was to prefer such an opportunity before a vain affection; but yet could not prevail till openly he sware that he would (if at any time the Lacedaemonians brake this treaty) come back again, and be their captain.
   So, then, after a few days, setting them in perfect order, he took his leave of them, whose eyes bade him farewell with tears, and mouths with kissing the places where he stepped, and after, making temples unto him as to a demi-god, thinking it beyond the degree of humanity to have a wit so far over-going his age, and such dreadful terror proceed from so excellent beauty. But he for his sake obtained free pardon for Argalus, whom also (upon oath never to bear arms against the Helots) he delivered; and taking only with him certain principal jewels of his own, he would have parted alone with Argalus (whose countenance well showed, while Parthenia was lost, he counted not himself delivered) but that the whole multitude would needs guard him into Arcadia; where again leaving them all to lament his departure, he by enquiry got to the well-known house of Kalander. There was he received with loving joy of Kalander; with joyful love of Palladius; with humble, though doleful, demeanour of Aigalus (whom specially both he and Palladius regarded); with grateful serviceableness of Clitophon, and honourable admiration of all. For being now well viewed to have no hair of his face to witness him a man, who had done acts beyond the degree of a man, and to look with a certain almost bashful kind of modesty as if he feared the eyes of men, who was unmoved with sight of the most horrible countenances of death, and, as if nature had mistaken her work, to have a Mars’ heart in a Cupid’s body; all that beheld him (and all that might behold him, did behold him) made their eyes quick messengers to their minds that there they had seen the uttermost that in mankind might be seen. The like wonder Palladius had before stirred but that Daiphantus, as younger and newer come, had gotten now the advantage in the moist and fickle impression of eye-sight But while all men, saving poor Argalus, made the joy of their eyes speak for their hearts towards Daiphantus, fortune (that belike was bid to that banquet, and meant then to play the good-fellow) brought a pleasant adventure among them.
   It was that as they had newly dined, there came in to Kalander a messenger that brought him word a young noble lady, near kinswoman to the fair Helen, queen of Corinth, was come thither, and desired to be lodged in his house. Kalander, most glad of such an occasion, went out, and all his other worthy guests with him saving only Argalus who remained in his chamber, desirous that this company were once broken up, that he might go in his solitary quest after Parthenia. But when they met this lady, Kalander straight thought he saw his niece Parthenia, and was about in such familiar sort to have spoken unto her, but she, in grave and honourable manner giving him to understand that he was mistaken, he, half ashamed, excused himself with the exceeding likeness was between them, though indeed it seemed that this lady "was of the more pure and dainty complexion. She said it might very well be, having been many times taken one for another. But as soon as she was brought into the house, before she would rest her, she desired to speak with Argalus publicly who, she heard, Was in the house. Argalus came hastily, and as hastily thought as Kalander had done, with sudden changes of joy into sorrow. But she, when she had stayed their thoughts with telling them her name and quality, in this sort spake unto him:
   ‘My Lord Argalus,’ said she, ‘being of late left in the court of queen Helen of Corinth as chief in her absence, she being upon some occasion gone thence, there came unto me the lady Parthenia, so disfigured as I think Greece hath nothing so ugly to behold. For my part, it was many days before with vehement oaths and some good proofs she could make me think that she was Parthenia. Yet at last finding certainly it was she and greatly pitying her misfortune, so much the more as that all men had ever told me, as now you do, of the great likeness between us, I took the best care I could of her, and of her understood the whole tragical history of her undeserved adventure; and therewithal of that most noble constancy in you, my lord Argalus, which whosoever loves not, shows himself to be a hater of virtue and unworthy to live in the society of mankind. But no outward cherishing could salve the inward sore of her mind; but a few days since she died, before her death earnestly desiring and persuading me to think of no husband but of you, as of the only man in the world worthy to be loved. Withal she gave me this ring to deliver you, desiring you, and by the authority of love commanding you, that the affection you bare her you should turn to me, assuring you that nothing can please her soul more than to see you and me matched together. Now my lord, though this office be not, perchance, suitable to my estate nor sex, who should rather look to be desired, yet an extraordinary desert requires an extraordinary proceeding; and therefore I am come, with faithful love built upon your worthiness, to offer myself, and to beseech you to accept the offer: and if these noble gentlemen present will say it is great folly, let them withal say, it is great love.’
   And then she stayed, earnestly attending Argalus’ answer; who, first making most hearty sighs do such obsequies as he could to Parthenia, thus answered her:
   ‘Madam,’ said he, ‘infinitely am I bound unto you for this no more rare than noble courtesy; but most bound for the goodness I perceive you showed to the lady Parthenia’; (with that the tears ran down his eyes, but he followed on) ‘and as much as so unfortunate a man, fit to be the spectacle of misery, can do you a service, determine you have made a purchase of a slave, while I live, never to fail you. But this great matter you propose unto me, wherein I am not so blind as not to see what happiness it should be unto me: excellent lady, know that if my heart were mine to give, you before all other should have it. But Parthenia’s it is, though dead. There I began: there I end all matter of affection. I hope I shall not long tarry after her, with whose beauty if I had only been in love, I should be so with you who have the same beauty. But it was Parthenia’s self I loved and love, which no likeness can make one, no commandment dissolve, no foulness defile, nor no death finish.'
   ‘And shall I receive,’ said she, ‘such disgrace as to be refused?' ‘Noble lady,' said he, ‘let not that hard word be used, who know your exceeding worthiness far beyond my desert; but it is only happiness I refuse, since of the only happiness I could and can desire, I am refused.'
   He had scarce spoken those words, when she ran to him and embracing him, ‘Why then Argalus/ said she, ‘take thy Parthenia.' And Parthenia it was indeed. But because sorrow forbade him too soon to believe, she told him the truth, with all circumstances: how being parted alone, meaning to die in some solitary place, as she happened to make her complaint, the queen Helen of Corinth (who likewise felt her part of miseries) being then walking lonely in that lovely place, heard her and never left till she had known the whole discourse. Which the noble queen greatly pitying, she sent her to a physician of hers, the most excellent man in the world, in hope he could help her; which in such sort as they saw he had performed; and she, taking with her of the queen’s servants, thought yet to make this trial whether he would quickly forget his true Parthenia or no. Her speech was confirmed by the Corinthian gentlemen who before had kept her counsel, and Argalus easily persuaded to what more than ten thousand years of life he desired; and Kalander would needs have the marriage celebrated in his house, principally the longer to hold his dear guests, towards whom he was now, besides his own habit of hospitality, carried with love and duty, and therefore omitted no service that his wit could invent and power minister.
   
   CHAPTER 8
   But no way he saw he could so much pleasure them as by leaving the two friends alone; who being shrunk aside to the banqueting- house where the pictures were, there Palladius recounted unto him that after they had both abandoned the burning ship and either of them taken something under him the better to support him to the shore, he knew not how, but either with over-labouring in the fight and sudden cold or the too much receiving of saltwater, he was past himself: but yet holding fast (as the nature of dying men is to do) the chest that was under him, he was cast on the sands, where he was taken up by a couple of shepherds, and by them brought to life again and kept from drowning himself when he despaired of his safety. How after having failed to take him into the fisher-boat, he had by the shepherds’ persuasion come to this gentleman’s house; where being dangerously sick, he had yielded to seek the recovery of health only for that he might the sooner go seek the delivery of Pyrocles; to which purpose Kalander by some friends of his in Messenia had already set a ship or two abroad, when this accident of Clitophon’s taking had so blessedly procured t eir meeting. Then did he set forth unto him the noble entertainment and careful cherishing of Kalander towards him, and so upon occasion of the pictures present, delivered with the frankness of a friend’s tongue, as near as could be, word by word what Kalander had told him touching the strange story (with all the particularities belonging) of Arcadia; which did in many sorts so delight Pyrocles to hear that he would needs have much of it again repeated, and was not contented till Kalander himself had answered him divers questions.
   But first at Musidorus’ request, though in brief manner, his mind much running upon the strange story of Arcadia, he did declare by what course of adventures he was come to make up their mutual happiness in meeting.
   ‘When, cousin,' said he, ‘we had stripped ourselves, and were both leaped into the sea, and swam a little towards the shore, I found by reason of some wounds I had that I should not be able to get the land, and therefore turned back again to the mast of the ship where you found me, assuring myself that if you came alive to shore, you would seek me; if you were lost, as I thought it as good to perish as to live, so that place as good to perish in as another. There I found my sword among some of the shrouds, wishing, I must confess, if I died, to be found with that in my hand, and withal waving it about my head that sailors by might have the better glimpse of me. There you missing me, I was taken up by pirates, who putting me under board prisoner, presently set upon another ship and maintaining a long fight, in the end put them all to the sword. Amongst whom I might hear them greatly praise one young man who fought most valiantly, whom (as love is careful, and misfortune subject to doubtfulness) I thought certainly to be you. And so holding you as dead, from that time till the time I saw you, in truth I sought nothing more than a noble end, which perchance made me more hardy than otherwise I would have been.
   ‘Trial whereof came within two days after; for the kings of Lacedaemon having set out some galleys under the charge of one of their nephews to scour the sea of the pirates, they met with us, our captain, wanting men, was driven to arm some of his prisoners, with promise of liberty for well fighting: among whom I was one; and being boarded by the admiral, it was my fortune to kill Eurileon the king’s nephew. But in the end they prevailed and we were all taken prisoners, I not caring much what became of me, only keeping the name of Daiphantus, according to the resolution you know is between us.
   ‘But being laid in the jail of Tenaria, with special hate to me for the death of Eurileon, the popular sort of that town conspired with the Helots and so by night opened them the gates; where entering and killing all of the genteel and rich faction, for honesty-sake brake open all prisons and so delivered me: and I, moved with gratefulness and encouraged with carelessness of life, so behaved myself in some conflicts they had in few days, that they barbarously thinking unsensible wonders of me, and withal so much the better trusting me as they heard I was hated of the king of Lacedaemon - their chief captain (being slain, as you know, by the noble Argalus) who helped thereunto by his persuasion, having borne a great affection unto me; and to avoid the dangerous emulation which grew among the chief who should have the place; and also affected as rather to have a stranger than a competitor — they elected me (God wot little proud of that dignity!) restoring unto me such things of mine as, being taken first by the pirates and then by the Lacedaemonians, they had gotten in the sack of the town. Now being in it, so good was my success with many victories that I made a peace for them to their own liking, the very day that you delivered Clitophon whom I, with much ado, had preserved. And in my peace the king Amiclas of Lacedaemon would needs have me banished and deprived of the dignity where- unto I was exalted: which (and you may see how much you are bound to me) for your sake I was content to suffer, a new hope rising in me that you were not dead, and so meaning to travail over the world to seek you. And now here, my dear Musidorus, you have me.’
   And with that, embracing and kissing each other, they called Kalander, of whom Daiphantus desired to hear the full story which before he had recounted to Palladius, and to see the letter of Philanax, which he read and well marked.
    But within some days after, the marriage between Argalus and the fair Parthenia being to be celebrated, Daiphantus and Palladius, seeing some of their jewels, furnished themselves of very fair apparel, meaning to do honour to their loving host, who, as much for their sakes as for the marriage, set forth each thing in most gorgeous manner. But all the cost bestowed did not so much enrich, nor all the fine deckings so much beautify, nor all the dainty devices so much delight, as the fairness of Parthenia, the pearl of all the maids of Mantinea; who as she went to the temple to be married, her eyes themselves seemed a temple wherein love and beauty were married. Her lips though they were kept close with modest silence, yet with a pretty kind of natural swelling they seemed to invite the guests that looked on them; her cheeks blushing and withal, when she was spoken unto, a little smiling, were like roses when their leaves are with a little breath stirred; her hair, being laid at the full length down her back, bare show as, if the vaward failed, yet that would conquer.
   Daiphantus marking her, ‘O Jupiter!’ said he speaking to Palladius, ‘how happens it that beauty is only confined to Arcadia?’ But Palladius not greatly attending his speech, some days were continued in the solemnizing the marriage, with all conceits that might deliver delight to men’s fancies.
   CHAPTER 9
   But such a change was grown in Daiphantus that (as if cheerfulness had been tediousness, and good entertainment were turned to discourtesy) he would ever get himself alone, though almost when he was in company he was alone, so little attention he gave to any that spake unto him. Even the colour and figure of his face began to receive some alteration, which he shewed little to heed; but every morning early going abroad either to the garden or to some woods towards the desert, it seemed his only comfort was to be without a comforter. But long it could not be hid from Palladius, whom true love made ready to mark and long knowledge able to mark; and therefore being now grown weary of his abode in Arcadia, having informed himself fully of the strength and riches of the country, of the nature of the people and manner of their laws; and, seeing the court could not be visited, prohibited to all men but to certain shepherdish people, he greatly desired a speedy return to his own country after the many mazes of  fortune he had trodden. But perceiving this great alteration in his friend, he thought first to break with him thereof and then to hasten his return, whereto he found him but smally inclined: whereupon one day taking him alone with certain graces and countenances, as if he were disputing with the trees, began in this manner to say unto him: ‘A mind well trained and long exercised in virtue, my sweet and worthy cousin, doth not easily change any course it once undertakes but upon well-grounded and well-weighed causes; for being witness to itself of its own inward good, it finds nothing without it of so high a price for which it should be altered. Even the very countenance and behaviour of such a man doth shew forth images of the same constancy, by maintaining a right harmony betwixt it and the inward good, in yielding itself suitable to the virtuous resolution of the mind. This speech I direct to you, noble friend Pyrocles, the excellency of whose mind and well chosen course in virtue if I do not sufficiently know, having seen such rare demonstrations of it, it is my weakness, and not your unworthi-ness:but as indeed I know it, and knowing it, most dearly love both it and him that hath it, so must I needs say that since our late coming into this country, I have marked in you, I will not say an alteration, but a relenting truly, and a slackening of the main career you had so notably begun and almost performed, and that in such sort as I cannot find sufficient reason in my great love toward you how to allow it: for (to leave off other secreter arguments which my acquaintance with you makes me easily find) this in effect to any man may be manifest, that whereas you were wont in all places you came to give yourself vehemently to the knowledge of those things which might better your mind, to seek the familiarity of excellent men in learning and soldiery, and lastly, to put all these things in practice, both by continual wise proceding and worthy enterprises as occasion fell for them; you now leave all these things undone: you let your mind fall asleep: beside your countenance troubled, which surely comes not of virtue, for virtue, like the clear heaven, is without clouds: and lastly, you subject yourself to solitariness, the sly enemy that doth most separate a man from well doing.’ Pyrocles’ mind was all this while so fixed upon another devotion that he no more attentively marked his friend's discourse than the child that hath leave to play marks the last part of his lesson, or the diligent pilot in a dangerous tempest doth attend the unskilful words of a passenger: yet the very sound having imprinted the general point of his speech in his heart, pierced with any mislike of so dearly an esteemed friend, and desirous by degrees to bring him to a gentler consideration of him, with a shamefast look, witnessing he rather could not help than did not know his fault, answered him to this purpose:
   ‘Excellent Musidorus, in the praise you gave me in the beginning of your speech I easily acknowledge the force of your good will unto me; for neither could you have thought so well of me if extremity of love had not made your judgement partial, nor could you have loved me so entirely if you had not been apt to make so great, though undeserved, judgements of me; and even so must I say to those imperfections to w-hich, though I have ever through weakness been subject, yet you by the daily mending of your mind have of late been able to look into them, which before you could not discern; so that thechange you speak of falls not out by my impairing but by your bettering. And yet under the leave of your better judgement, I must needs say thus much, my dear cousin, that I find not myself wholly to be condemned because I do not with continual vehemency follow those knowledges, which you call the bettering of my mind; for both the mind itself must, like other things, sometimes be unbent, or else it will be either weakened or broken; and these knowledges, as they are of good use, so are they not all the mind may stretch itself unto. Who knows whether I feed not my mind with higher thoughts? Truly, as I know not all the particularities, so yet I see the bounds of all these knowledges: but the workings of the mind I find much more infinite than can be led unto by the eye, or imagined by any that distract their thoughts without themselves. And in such contemplation or, as I think, more excellent, I enjoy my solitariness, and my solitariness perchance is the nurse of these contemplations. Eagles we see fly alone, and they are but sheep which always herd together. Condemn not therefore my mind sometime to enjoy itself, nor blame not the taking of such times as serve most fit for it. And alas, dear Musjdorus, if I be sad, who knows better than you the just causes I have of sadness?' And here Pyrocles suddenly stopped, like a man unsatisfied in himself, though his wit might well have served to have satisfied another. And so looking with a countenance as though he desired he should know his mind without hearing him speak, and yet desirous to speak, to breathe out some part of his inward evil, sending again new blood to his face, he continued his speech in this manner:
   ‘And Lord, dear cousin,’ said he, ‘doth not the pleasantness of this place carry in itself sufficient reward for any time lost in it? Do you not see how all things conspire together to make this country a heavenly dwelling? Do you not see the grass, how in colour they excel the emeralds, every one striving to pass his fellow, and yet they are all kept of an equal height? And see you not the rest of these beautiful flowers, each of which would require a man’: wit to know and his life to express? Do not these stately trees seem to maintain their flourishing old age with the only happiness of their seat, being clothed with a continual spring, because no beauty here should ever fade? Doth not the air breathe health, which the birds, delightful both to ear and eye, do daily solemnize with the sweet consent of their voices? Is not every echo thereof a perfect music? And these fresh and delightful brooks, how slowly they slide away, as loth to leave the company of so many things united in perfection, and with how sweet a murmur they lament their forced departure? Certainly, certainly, cousin, it must needs be that some goddess inhabiteth this region, who is the soul of this soil: for neither is any less than a goddess worthy to be shrined in such a heap of pleasures, nor any less than a goddess could have made it so perfect a plot of the celestial dwellings.’
   And so ended with a deep sigh, ruefully casting his eye upon Musidorus, as more desirous of pity than pleading.
   But Musidorus had all this while held his look fixed upon Pyrocles’ countenance, and with no less loving attention marked how his words proceeded from him; but in both these he perceived such strange diversities that they rather increased new doubts than gave him ground to settle any judgement For besides his eyes sometimes even great with tears, the oft changing of his colour, with a kind of shaking unstaidness over all his body, he might see in his countenance some great determination mixed with fear, and might perceive in him store of thoughts rather stirred than digested; his words interrupted continually with sighs (which served as a burthen to each sentence) and the tenor of his speech (though of his wonted phrase) not knit together to one constant end, hut rather dissolved in itself as the vehemency of the inward passion prevailed: which made Musidorus frame his answer nearest to that humour which should soonest put out the secret.
   For having in the beginning of Pyrocles' speech, which defended his solitariness, framed in his mind a reply against it in the praise of honourable action, in showing that such a kind of contemplation is but a glorious title to idleness; that in action a man did not only better himself but benefit others; that the gods would not have delivered a soul into the body which hath arms and legs, only instruments of doing, but that it were intended the mind should employ them; and that the mind should best know his own good or evil by practice, which knowledge was the only way to increase the one and correct the other; besides many other arguments which the plentifulness of the matter yielded to the sharpness of his wit: when he found Pyrocles leave that and fall into such an affected praising of the place, he left it likewise and joined with him therein,because he found him in that humour utter more store of passion: and even thus kindly embracing him, he said:
   ‘Your words are such, noble cousin, so sweetly and strongly handled in the praise of solitariness, as they would make me likewise yield myself up into it but that the same words make me know it is more pleasant to enjoy the company of him that can speak such words than by such words to be persuaded to follow solitariness. And even so do I give you leave, sweet Pyrocles, ever to defend solitariness, so long as to defend it, you ever keep company. But I marvel at the excessive praises you give to this country. In truth it is not unpleasant, but yet if you would return into Macedon you should either see many heavens, or find this no more than earthly. And even Tempe in my Thessalia (where you and I, to my great happiness, were brought up together) is nothing inferior unto it But I think you will make me see that the vigour of your wit can show itself in any subject: or else you feed sometimes your solitariness with the conceits of the poets, whose liberal pens can as easily travel over mountains as molehills and so, like well-disposed men, set up everything to the highest note; especially, when they put such words in the mouths of one of these fantastical, mind- infected people that children and musicians call “Lovers”.'
   This word 'Lover' did no less pierce poor Pyrocles than the right tune of music toucheth him that is sick of the Tarantula. There was not one part of his body that did not feel a sudden motion, while his heart with panting seemed to dance to the sound of that word. Yet after some pause, lifting up his eyes a little from the ground, and yet not daring to place them in the eyes of Musidorus, armed with the very countenance of the poor prisoner at the bar whose answer is nothing but ‘Guilty', with much ado he brought forth this question:
   'And alas,' said he, ‘dear cousin, what if I be not so much the poet (the freedom of whose pen can exercise itself in anything) as even that miserable subject of his cunning whereof you speak?'
   ‘Now the eternal gods forbid,' mainly cried out Musidorus, ‘that ever my ear should be poisoned with so evil news of you. O let me never know that any base affection should get any lordship in your thoughts/
   But as he was speaking more, Kalander came and brake off their discourse with inviting them to the hunting of a goodly stag, which being harboured in a wood thereby, he hoped would make them good sport, and drive away some part of Daiphantus' melancholy. They condescended, and so going to their lodgings, furnished themselves as liked them, Daiphantus writing a few words which he left sealed in a letter against their return.
   CHAPTER 10
   Then went they together abroad, the good Kalander entertaining them with pleasant discoursing how well he loved the sport of hunting when he was a young man; how much in the comparison thereof he disdained all chamber-delights; that the sun (how great a journey soever he had to make) could never prevent him with earliness, nor the moon with her sober countenance dissuade him trom watching till midnight for the deer feeding.
   ‘O,' said he, ‘you will never live to my age without you keep yourselves in breath with exercise and in heart with jovfulness. Too much thinking doth consume the spirits, and oft it falls out that while one thinks too much of his doing, he leaves to do the effect of his thinking.'
   Then spared he not to remember how much Arcadia was changed since his youth; activity and good fellowship being nothing in the price it was then held in, but, according to the nature of the old-growing world, still worse and worse. Then would he tell them stories of such gallants as he had known: and so with pleasant company beguiled the time’s haste and shortened the way’s length, till they came to the side of the wood, where the hounds were in couples staying their coming, but with a whining accent craving liberty, many of them in colour and marks so resembling, that it shewed they were of one kind. The huntsmen handsomely attired in their green liveries as though they were children of summer, with staves in their hands to beat the guiltless earth when the hounds w'ere at a fault, and with horns about their necks to sound an alarm upon a silly fugitive. The hounds were straight uncoupled, and ere long the stag thought it better to trust to the nimbleness of his feet than to the slender fortification of his lodging: but even his feet betrayed him, for howsoever they went, they themselves uttered themselves to the scent of their enemies, who (one taking it of another, and sometimes believing the wind’s advertisements, sometimes the view of their faithful counsellors, the huntsmen) with open mouths then denounced war when the war was already begun; their cry being composed of so well-sorted mouths that any man would perceive therein some kind of proportion, but the skilful woodmen did find a music. Then delight and variety of opinion drew the horsemen sundry ways, yet cheering their hounds with voice and horn, kept still, as it were, together. The wood seemed to conspire with them against his own citizens, dispersing their noise through all his quarters; and even the nymph Echo left to bewail the loss of Narcissus and became a hunter. But the stag was in the end so hotly pursued that, leaving his flight, he was driven to make courage of despair, and so, turning his head, made the hounds with change of speech to testify that he was at a bay, as if from hot pursuit of their enemy they were suddenly come to a parley.
   But Kalander, by his skill of coasting the country, was among the first that came in to the besieged deer; whom when some of the younger sort would have killed with their swords, he would not suffer, but with a cross-bow sent a death to the poor beast, who with tears showed the unkindness he took of man’s cruelty.
   But by the time that the whole company was assembled and that the stag had bestowed himself liberally among them that had killed him, Daiphantus was missed, for whom Palladius carefully inquiring, no news could be given him but by one that said he thought he was returned home, for that he marked him, in the chief of, the hunting, take a bye-way which might lead to Ka- lander’s house. That answer for the time satisfying, and they having performed all duties as well for the stag's funeral as the hounds' triumph, they returned; some talking of the fatness of the deer's body; some of the fairness of his head; some of the hounds’ cunning; some of their speed, and some of their cry; till coming home, about the time that the candles begin to inherit the sun’s office, they found Daiphantus was not to be found. Whereat Palladius greatly marvelling, and a day or two passing while neither search nor inquiry could help him to knowledge, at last he lighted upon the letter which Pyrocles had written before he went a hunting, and left in his study among other of his writings. The letter was directed to Palladius himself and contained these words:
   My only friend, violence of love leads me into such a course, whereof your knowledge may much more vex you than help me. Therefore pardon my concealing it from you, since, if I wrong you, it is in the respect I bear you. Return into Thessalia, I pray you, as full of good fortune as I am of desire; and if I five, I will in a short time follow you; if I die, love my memory.
   This was all, and this Palladius read twice or thrice over. ‘Ah,’ said he, ‘Pyrocles, what means this alteration? What have I deserved of thee to be thus banished of thy counsels? Heretofore I have accused the sea, condemned the pirates, and hated my evil fortune that deprived me of thee; but now thyself is the sea which drowns my comfort; thyself is the pirate that robs thyself from me; thy own will becomes my evil fortune.’
   Then turned he his thoughts to all forms of guesses that might light upon the purpose and course of Pyrocles, for he was not sure by his words that it was love as he was doubtful where the love was. One time he thought some beauty in Laconia had laid hold of his eyes; another time he feared that it might be Parthenia’s excellency which had broken the bands of all former resolution. But the more he thought, the more he knew not what to think, armies of objections rising against any accepted opinion.
   Then as careful he was what to do himself: at length determined never to leave seeking him till his search should be either by meeting accomplished or by death ended. Therefore (for all the unkindness, bearing tender respect that his friend's secret determination should be kept from any suspicion in others) he went to Kalander and told him that he had received a message from his friend, by which he understood he was gone back again into Laconia about some matters greatly importing the poor men whose protection he had undertaken, and that it was in any sort fit for him to follow him, but in such private wise as not to be known, and that therefore he would as then bid him farewell; arming himself in a black armour as either a badge or prognostication of his mind, and taking only with him a good store of money and a few choice jewels, leaving the greatest number of them and most of his apparel with Kalander - which he did partly to give the more cause to Kalander to expect their return, and so to be the less curiously inquisitive after them - and partly to leave those honourable thanks unto him for his charge and kindness, which he knew he would no other way receive.
   The good old man, having neither reason to dissuade nor hope to persuade, received the things with mind of a keeper not of an owner; but before he went, desired he might have the happiness fully to know what they were, which, he said, he had ever till then delayed, fearing to be anyway importune; but now he could not be so much an enemy to his desires as any longer to imprison them in silence. Palladius told him that the matter was not secret but that so worthy a friend deserved the knowledge, and should have it as soon as he might speak with his friend, without whose consent - because their promise bound him otherwise - he could not reveal it; but bade him hold for most assured that if they lived but a while, he should find that they which bore the names of Daiphantus and Palladius would give him and his cause to think his noble courtesy well employed. Kalander would press him no further; but desiring that he might have leave to go, or at least to send his son and servants with him, Palladius brake off all ceremonies by telling him his case stood so that his greatest favour should be in making least ado of his parting. Wherewith Kalander, knowing it to be more cumber than courtesy to strive, abstained from further urging him, but not from hearty mourning the loss of so sweet a conversation.
   Only Clitophon by vehement importunity obtained to go with him to come again to Daiphantus, whom he named and accounted his lord. And in such private guise departed Palladius, though having a companion to talk withal yet talking much more with unkindness. And first they went to Mantinea, whereof because Parthenia was, he suspected there might be some cause of his abode. But, finding there no news of him, he went to Tegea, Ripa, Enispae, Stimphalus and Pheneus, famous for the poisonous Stygian water, and through all the rest of Arcadia, making their eyes, their ears and their tongues serve almost for nothing but that enquiry. But they could know nothing but that in none of those places he was known. And so went they, making one place succeed to another in like uncertainty to their search, many times encountering strange adventures worthy to be registered in the rolls of fame; but this may not be omitted. As they passed in a pleasant valley (of either side of which high hills lifted up their beetle-brows as if they would overlook the pleasantness of their under-prospect) they were by the daintiness of the place and the weariness of themselves invited to light from their horses; and pulling off their bits that they might something refresh their mouths upon the grass (which plentifully grew, brought up under the care of those well-shading trees) they themselves laid them down hard by the murmuring music of certain waters which spouted out of the side of the hills, and in the bottom of the valley made of many springs a pretty brook, like a commonwealth of many families.
   But when they had a while hearkened to the persuasion of sleep, they rose and walked onward in that shady place, till Clitophon espied a piece of armour and, not far off, another piece; and so the sight of one piece teaching him to look for more, he at length found all, with head-piece and shield, by the device whereof he straight knew it to be the armour of his cousin, the noble Amphialus. Whereupon (fearing some inconvenience happened unto him) he told both his doubt and cause of doubt to Palladius who, considering thereof, thought best to make no longer stay but to follow on, lest perchance some violence were offered to so worthy a knight wrhom the fame of the world seemed to set in balance with any knight living. Yet with a sudden conceit, having long bome great honour to the name of Amphialus, Palladius thought best to take that armour, thinking thereby to learn by them that should know that armour some news of Amphialus, and yet not hinder him in the search of Daiphantus too. So he, by the help of Clitophon, quickly put on that armour, whereof there was no one piece wanting, though hacked in some places, betraying some fight not long since passed. It was something too great, but yet served well enough.
   And so, getting on their horses, they travelled but a little waj when, in the opening of the mouth of the valley into a fair field, they met with a coach drawn with four milk-white horses furnished all in black, with a black-a-moor boy upon every horse, they all apparelled in white, the coach itself very richly furnished in black and white. But before they could come so near as to discern what was within, there came running upon them above a dozen horsemen who cried to them to yield themselves prisoners or else they should die. But Palladius, not accustomed to grant over the possession of himself upon so unjust titles, with sword drawn gave them so rude an answer that divers of them never had breath to reply again: for being well backed by Clitophon, and having an excellent horse under him, when he was overpressed by some he avoided them, and ere the other thought of it, punished in him his fellow’s faults, and so either with cunning or with force, or rather with a cunning force, left none of them either living or able to make his life serve to others’ hurt. Which being done, he approached the coach, assuring the black boys they should have no hurt, who were else ready to have run away; and looking into the coach, he found in the one end a lady of great beauty, and such a beauty as showed forth the beams both of wisdom and good nature, but all as much darkened as might be with sorrow. In the other, two ladies (who by their demeanour showed well they were but her servants) holding before them a picture in which was a goodly gentleman (whom he knew not) painted, having in their faces a certain waiting sorrow, their eyes being infected with their mistress’ weeping.
   But the chief lady having not so much as once heard the noise of this conflict (so had sorrow closed up all the entries of her mind, and love tied her senses to that beloved picture) now the shadow of him falling upon the picture made her cast up her eye; and seeing the armour which too well she knew, thinking him to be Amphialus, the lord of her desires (blood coming more freely into her cheeks as though it would be bold, and yet there, growing new again pale for fear) with a pitiful look, like one unjustly condemned,
   ‘My Lord Amphialus,’ said she, ‘you have enough punished me. It is time for cruelty to leave you, and evil fortune me. If not, I pray you (and to grant my prayer fitter time nor place you can have) accomplish the one even now, and finish the other.’
   With that, sorrow impatient to be slowly uttered in her often- staying speeches poured itself so fast in tears that Palladius could not hold her longer in error, but pulling off his helmet, ‘Madam,’ said he, ‘I perceive you mistake me. I am a stranger in these parts, set upon without any cause given by me by some of your servants, whom, because I have in my just defence evil entreated, I came to make my excuse to you, whom seeing such as I do, I find greater cause why I should crave pardon of you.’
   When she saw his face and heard his speech she looked out of the coach, and seeing her men, some slain, some lying under their dead horses and striving to get from under them, without making more account of the matter, ‘Truly,’ said she, ‘they are well served that durst lift up their arms against that armour. But, Sir Knight,’ said she, ‘I pray you tell me, how came you by this armour? For if it be by the death of him that owned it, then have I more to say unto you.’
   Palladius assured her it was not so, telling her the true manner how he found it.
   ‘It is like enough,’ said she, ‘for that agrees with the manner he hath lately used. But I beseech you, Sir,' said she, ‘since your prowess hath bereft me of my company, let it yet so far heal the wounds itself hath given as to guard me to the next town.'
   ‘How great soever my business be, fair lady,’ said he, ‘it shall willingly yield to so noble a cause. But first, even by the favour you bear to the lord of this noble armour, I conjure you to tell me the story of your fortune herein, lest hereafter, when the image of so excellent a lady in so strange a plight come before mine eyes, I condemn myself of want of consideration in not having demanded thus much. Neither ask I it without protestation that wherein my sword and faith may avail you they shall bind themselves to your service.’
   ‘Your conjuration, fair knight/ said she, ‘is too strong for my poor spirit to disobey, and that shall make me (without any other hope, my ruin being but by one unrelievable) to grant your will herein; and to say the truth, a strange niceness were it in me to refrain that from the ears of a person representing so much worthiness which I am glad even to rocks and woods to utter.’
   CHAPTER 11
   ‘Know you then that my name is Helen, queen by birth, and hitherto possessor of the fair city and territory of Corinth. I can say no more of myself but beloved of my people, and may justly say beloved, since they are content to bear with my absence and folly. But I being left by my father’s death, and accepted by my people in the highest degree that country could receive; as soon, or rather, before that my age was ripe for it, my court quickly swarmed full of suitors: some, perchance, loving my state, others my person; but once I know all of them, howsoever my possessions were in their hearts, my beauty, such as it is, was in their mouths: many strangers of princely and noble blood, and all  mine own country to whom either birth or virtue gave courage to avow so high a desire.
   ‘Among the rest, or rather, before the rest, was the lord Phil- oxenus, son and heir to the virtuous nobleman, Timotheus; which Timotheus was a man both in power, riches, parentage, and (which passed all these) goodness, and (which followed all these) love of the people, beyond any of the great men of my country. Now this son of his, I must say truly not unworthy of such a father, bending himself by all means of serviceableness to me, and setting forth of himself to win my favour, won thus far of me that in truth I less misliked him than any of the rest, which, in some proportion, my countenance delivered unto him - though, I must confess, it was a very false ambassador if it delivered at all any affection, whereof my heart was utterly void, I as then esteeming myself born to rule and thinking foul scorn willingly to submit myself to be ruled.
   ‘But while Philoxenus in good sort pursued my favour and perchance nourished himself with overmuch hope, because he found I did in some sort acknowledge his value, one time among the rest he brought with him a dear friend of his.’ With that she looked upon the picture before her and straight sighed, and straight tears followed, as if the idol of duty ought to be honoured with such oblations; and then her speech stayed the tale, having brought her to that look, but that look having quite put her out of her tale.
   But Palladius, greatly pitying so sweet a sorrow in a lady whom by fame he had already known and honoured, besought her for her promise sake to put silence so long unto her moaning, till she had recounted the rest of this story.
   ‘Why,’ said she, ‘this is the picture of Amphialus. What need I say more to you? What ear is so barbarous but hath heard of Amphialus? Who follows deeds of arms, but everywhere finds monuments of Amphialus? Who is courteous, noble, liberal, but he that hath the example before his eyes of Amphialus? Where are all heroical parts but in Amphialus? O Amphialus, I would thou were not so excellent, or I would I thought thee not so excellent, and yet would I not that I would so.'
   With that she wept again, till he again soliciting the conclusion of her story: ‘Then must you,’ said she, ‘know the story of Amphialus, for his will is my life, his life my history; and indeed in what can I better employ my lips than in speaking of Amphialus.
   'This knight, then,, whose figure you see, but whose mind can be painted by nothing but by the true shape of virtue, is brother’s son to Basilius, King of Arcadia, and in his childhood esteemed his heir, till Basilius, in his old years marrying a young and a fair lady, had of her those two daughters, so famous for their perfection in beauty, which put by their young cousin from that expectation. Whereupon his mother (a woman of an haughty heart, being daughter to the King of Argos) either disdaining or fearing that her son should live under the power of Basilius, sent him to that lord Timotheus, between whom and her dead husband there had passed straight bands of mutual hospitality', to be brought up in company with his son Philoxenus.
   ‘A happy resolution for Amphialus, whose excellent nature was by this means trained on with as good education as any prince’s son in the w'orld could have, which otherwise it is thought his mother, far unworthy of such a son, would not have given him, the good Timotheus no less loving him than his own son. Well they grew in years; and shortly occasions fell aptly to try Amphialus, and all occasions were but steps for him to climb fame by. Nothing was so hard but his valour overcame; which yet still he so guided with true virtue that although no man was in our parts spoken of but he for his manhood, yet, as though therein he excelled himself, he was commonly called the courteous Amphialus. An endless thing it were for me to tell how many adventures, terrible to be spoken of, he achieved; what monsters, what giants, what conquests of countries, sometimes using policy, sometimes force, but always virtue well followed; and but followed by Philoxenus, between whom and him so fast a friendship by education was knit that at last Philoxenus, having no greater matter to employ his friendship in than to win me, therein desired and had his uttermost furtherance.
   ‘To that purpose brought he him to my court, where truly I may justly witness with him that what his wit could conceive (and his wit can conceive as far as the limits of reason stretch) was all directed to the setting forward the suit of his friend Philoxenus: my ears could hear nothing from him but touching the worthiness of Philoxenus, and of the great happiness it would be unto me to have such a husband, with many arguments which, God knows, I cannot well remember because I did not much believe. For why should I use many circumstances to come to that where already I am, and ever while I live must continue? In few words, while he pleaded for another, he won me for himself - if at least’ (with that she sighed) ‘he would account it a winning, for his fame had so framed the way to my mind that his presence, so full of beauty, sweetness and noble conversation, had entered there before he vouchsafed to call for the keys. O lord, how did my soul hang at his lips while he spake! O when he in feeling manner would describe the love of his friend, how well, thought I, doth love between those lips! When he would with daintiest eloquence stir pity in me toward Philoxenus, ‘Why sure,’ said I to myself, ‘Helen, be not afraid; this heart cannot want pity’: and when he would extol the deeds of Philoxenus — who indeed had but waited of him therein - alas, thought I, good Philoxenus, how evil doth it become thy name to be subscribed to his letter! What should I say? Nay, what should I not say, noble knight, 'who am not ashamed, nay am delighted thus to express mine own passions?
   ‘Days passed, his eagerness for his friend never decreased, my affection to him ever increased. At length, in way of ordinary courtesy, I obtained of him, who suspected no such matter, this his picture, the only Amphialus, I fear, that I shall ever enjoy; and grown bolder, or madder, or bold with madness, I discovered my affection unto him. But lord, I shall never forget how anger and courtesy at one instant appeared in his eyes when he heard that motion; how with his blush he taught me shame. In sum, he left nothing unassayed which might disgrace himself to grace his friend, in sweet terms making me receive a most resolute refusal of himself. But when he found that his presence did far more persuade for himself than his speech could do for his friend, he left my court, hoping that forgetfulness (which commonly waits upon absence) would make room for his friend, to whom he would not utter thus much, I think, for a kind fear not to grieve him; or perchance, though he cares little for me, of a certain honourable gratefulness not yet to discover so much of my secrets; but, as it should seem, meant to travel into far countries until his friend’s affcction either ceased or prevailed. But within a while, Philoxenus came to see how onward the fruits wjere of his friend’s labour, when - as in truth I cared not much how he took it - he found me sitting, beholding this picture I know not with how- affectionate countenance but I am sure with a most affectionate mind. I straight found jealousy and disdain took hold of him; and yet the forward pain of mine own heart made me so delight to punish him whom I esteemed the chiefest let in my way, that when he with humble gesture and vehement speeches sued for my favour,  told him that I would hear him more willingly if he would speak for Amphialus as well as Amphialus had done for him. He never answered me, but pale and quaking went straight away; and straightmy heart misgave mesome evil success. And yet, though I had authority enough to have stayed him (as in these fatal things it falls out that the high-working powers make second causes unwittingly accessory to their determinations) I did no further but sent a footman of mine, whose faithfulness to me I well knew, from place to place to follow him and bring me word of his proceedings, which, alas, have brought forth that which I fear I must ever rue.
   ‘For he had travelled scarce a day’s journey out of my country but that, not far from this place, he overtook Amphialus who, by succouring a distressed lady, had been here stayed, and by and by called him to fight with him, protesting that one of them two should die. You may easily judge how strange it was to Amphialus, whose heart could accuse itself of no fault but too much affection toward him, which he (refusing to fight with him) would fain have made Philoxenus understand. But, as my servant since told me, the more Amphialus went back, the more he followed, calling him traitor and coward, yet never telling the cause of this strange alteration.
   ‘ “Ah Philoxenus,” said Amphialus, “I know I am no traitor, and thou well knowest I am no coward: but I pray thee content thyself with this much, and let this satisfy thee that I love thee, since I bear thus much of thee.”
   ‘But he, leaving words, drew his sword and gave Amphialus a great blow or two which, but for the goodness of his armour, would have slain him; and yet so far did Amphialus contain himself, stepping aside, and saying to him,
   ‘ “Well, Philoxenus, and thus much villainy am I content to put up, not any longer for thy sake (whom I have no cause to love since thou dost injure me and wilt not tell me the cause) but for thy virtuous father’s sake to whom I am so much bound. I pray thee go away and conquer thy own passions and thou shalt make me soon yield to be thy servant.”
   ‘But he would not attend to his words, but still strake so fiercely at Amphialus that in the end, nature prevailing above determination, he was fain to defend himself, and withal so to offend him that by an unlucky blow the poor Philoxenus fell dead at his feet, having had time only to speak some words whereby Amphialus knew it was for my sake: which when Amphialus saw, he forthwith gave such tokens of true-felt sorrow that, as my servant said, no imagination could conceive greater woe but that by and by an unhappy occasion made Amphialus pass himself in sorrow. For Philoxenus was but newly dead, when there comes to the same place the aged and virtuous Timotheus, who, having heard of his son’s sudden and passionate manner of parting from my court, had followed him as speedily as he could, but, alas, not so speedily but that he found him dead before he could overtake him. Though my heart be nothing but a stage for tragedies, yet, I must confess, it is even unable to bear the miserable representation thereof, knowing Amphialus and Timotheus as I have done. Alas, what sorrow, what amazement, what shame was in Amphialus when he saw his dear foster-father find him the killer of his only son! In my heart, I know he wished mountains had lain upon him to keep him from that meeting. As for Timotheus, sorrow of his son and, I think principally, unkindness of Amphialus so devoured his vital spirits that, able to say no more but ‘‘Amphialus, Amphialus, have I - ” he sank to the earth and presently died.
   But not my tongue, though daily used to complaints; no, nor if my heart (which is nothing but sorrow) were turned to tongues, durst it undertake to show the unspeakableness of his grief. But (because this serves to make you know my fortune) he threw away his armour, even this which you have now upon you, which at the first sight I vainly hoped he had put on again; and then, as ashamed of the light, he ran into the thickest of the woods, lamenting, and even crying out so pitifully that my servant, though cf a fortune not used to much tenderness, could not refrain weeping when he told it me. He once overtook him; but Amphialus drawing his sword, which was the only part of his arms (God knows to what purpose) he carried about him, threatened to kill him if he followed him, and withal bade him deliver this bitter message, that he well enough found I was the cause of all this mischief, and that if I were a man, he would go over the world to kill me; but bade me assure myself that of all creatures in the world he most hated me. Ah, Sir knight (whose ears I think by this time are tired with the rugged ways of these misfortunes) now weigh my case, if at least you know what love is. For this cause have I left my country, putting in hazard how my people will in time deal by me, adventuring what perils or dishonours might ensue, only to follow him who proclaimeth hate against me, and to bring my neck unto him, if that may redeem my trespass and assuage his fury. And now, Sir,’ said she, ‘you have your request: I pray you take pains to guide me to the next town, that there I may gather such of my company again as your valour hath left me.’
   Palladius willingly condescended; but ere they began to go, there came Clitophon who, having been something hurt by one of them, had pursued him a good way: at length overtaking him and ready to kill him, understood they were servants to the fair queen Helen, and that the cause of this enterprise was for nothing but to make Amphialus prisoner whom they knew their mistress sought, for she concealed her sorrow nor cause of her sorrow from nobody. But Clitophon, very sorry for this accident, came back to comfort the queen, helping such as were hurt in the best sort that he could, and framing friendly constructions of this rashly undertaken enmity; when in comes another, till that time unseen, all armed, with his beaver down, who first looking round about upon the company, as soon as he spied Palladius, he drew his sword, and making no other prologue, let fly at him. But Palladius, sorry for so much harm as had already happened, sought rather to retire and ward, thinking he might be someone that belonged to the fair queen whose case in his heart he pitied. Which Clitophon seeing, stepped between them, asking the new-come knight the cause of his quarrel, who answered him that he would kill that thief who had stolen away his master’s armour, if he did not restore it. With that Palladius looked upon him and saw that he of the other side had Palladius’ own armour upon him.
   ‘Truly,’ said Palladius, ‘if I have stolen this armour, you did not buy that; but you shall not fight with me upon such a quarrel. You shall have this armour willingly, which I did only put on to do honour to the owner.’
   But Clitophon straight knew by his words and voice that it was Ismenus, the faithful and diligent page of Amphialus; and therefore telling him that he was Clitophon, and willing him to acknowledge his error to the other, who deserved all honour, the young gentleman pulled off his head-piece and, lighting, went to kiss Palladius’ hands, desiring him to pardon his folly caused by extreme grief, which easily might bring forth anger.
   'Sweet gentleman,’ said Palladius, ‘you shall only make me this amends, that you shall carry this your lord's armour from me to him, and tell him from an unknown knight, who admires his worthiness, that he cannot cast a greater mist over his glory than by being unkind to so excellent a princess as this queen is.’
   Ismenus promised he would, as soon as he durst find his master; and with that went to do his duty to the queen, whom in all these encounters astonishment made hardy. But as soon as she saw Ismenus, looking to her picture, ‘Ismenus,’ said she, ‘here is my lord; where is yours? Or come you to bring me some sentence of death from him? If it be so, welcome be it I pray you speak, and speak quickly.’
   ‘Alas, Madam,’ said Ismenus, ‘I have lost my lord;’ - with that tears came into his eyes - ‘for as soon as the unhappy combat was concluded with the death both of father and son, my master, casting off his armour, went his way, forbidding me upon pain of death to follow him. Yet divers days I followed his steps, till lastly I found him, having newly met writh an excellent spaniel belonging to his dead companion Philoxenus. The dog straight fawned on my master for old knowledge, but never was there thing more pitiful than to hear my master blame the dog for loving his master’s murderer, renewing afresh his complaints with the dumb counsellor, as if they might comfort one another in their miseries. But my lord, having spied me, rase up in such rage that in truth I feared he would kill me: yet as then he said only, if I would not displease him, I should not come near him till he sent for me: too hard a commandment for me to disobey. I yielded, leaving him only waited on by his dog, and, as I think, seeking out the most solitary places that this or any other country can grant him: and I, returning where I had left his armour, found another instead thereof, and (disdaining, I must confess, that any should bear the armour of the best knight living) armed myself therein to play the fool, as even now I did.’
   ‘Fair Ismenus,’ said the queen, ‘a fitter messenger could hardly be to unfold my tragedy. I see the end, I see my end.’
   With that, sobbing, she desired to be conducted to the next town, where Palladius left her to be waited on by Clitophon, at Palladius’ earnest entreaty, who desired alone to take that melancholy course of seeking liis friend; and therefore changing armours again with Ismenus, who went withal to a castle belonging to his master, he continued his quest for his friend Daiphantus.
   CHAPTER 12
   So directed he his course to Laconia, as well among the Helots as Spartans. There indeed he found his fame flourishing, his monuments engraved in marble, and yet more durably in men’s memories; but the universal lamenting his absented presence assured him of his present absence. Thence into the Elean province, to see whether at the Olympian games there celebrated he might in such concourse bless his eyes with so desired an encounter: but that huge and sportful assembly grew to him a tedious loneliness, esteeming nobody found, since Daiphantus was lost. Afterwards he passed through Achaia and Sicyonia, to the Corinthians, proud of their two seas, to learn whether by the strait of that Isthmus it were possible to know of his passage. But finding every place more dumb than other to his demands, and remembering that it was late-taken love which had wrought this new course, he returned again, after two months travel in vain, to make a fresh search in Arcadia; so much the more as then first he bethought himself of the picture of Philoclea which, resembling her he had once loved, might perhaps awake again that sleeping passion. And having already passed over the greatest part of Arcadia, one day coming under the side of the pleasant mountain Maenalus, his horse, nothing guilty of his inquisitiveness, with flat tiring taught him that discreet stays make speedy journeys: and therefore lighting down and unbridling his horse, he himself went to repose himself in a little wood he saw thereby; where lying under the protection of a shady tree, with intention to make forgetting sleep comfort a sorrowful memory, he saw a sight which persuaded and obtained of his eyes that they would abide yet a while open. It was the appearing of a lady who, because she walked with her side toward him, he could not perfectly see her face, but so much he might see of her that was a surety for the rest that all was excellent.
   'Well might he perceive the hanging of her hair in fairest quantity in locks, some curled and some as it were forgotten, with such a careless care and an art so hiding art that she seemed she would lay them for a pattern whether nature simply or nature helped by cunning be the more excellent: the rest whereof was drawn into a coronet of gold richly set with pearl, and so joined all over with gold wires and covered with feathers of divers colours that it was not unlike to an helmet, such a glittering show it bare, and so bravely it was held up from the head. Upon her body she ware a doublet of sky-colour satin, covered with plates of gold and, as it were, nailed with precious stones that in it she might seem armed. The nether part of her garment was so full of stuff and cut after such a fashion, that though the length of it reached to the ankles, yet in her going one might sometimes discern the small of her leg, which with the foot was dressed in a short pair of crimson velvet buskins, in some places open, as the ancient manner was, to show the fairness of the skin. Cher all this she ware a cettairi mantle made in such manner, that coming under her right arm and covering most of that side, it had no fastening on the left side but only upon the top of her shoulder, where the two ends met and were closed together with a very rich jewel: the device whereof, as he after saw, was this: a Hercules made in little form, but set with a distaff in his hand, as he once was by Omphale’s commandment, with a word in Greek but thus to be interpreted, ‘Never more valiant.’ On the same side, on her thigh she wrare a sword which, as it witnessed her to be an Amazon or one following that profession, so it seemed but a needless weapon, since her other forces were without withstanding.
   But this lady walked out-right till he might see her enter into a fine close arbour. It was of trees, whose branches so lovingly interlaced one the other that it could resist the strongest violence of eyesight; but she went into it by a door she opened, wrhich moved him, as warily as he could, to follow her; and by and by he might hear her sing this song with a voice no less beautiful to his ears than her goodliness was full of harmony to his eyes:
Transform'd in show, but more transform'd in mind,
I cease to strive, with double conquest foil’d:
For, woe is me, my powers all I find
With outward force, and inward treason, spoil’d.
For from without came to mine eyes the blow,
Whereto mine inward throughts did faintly yield:
Both these conspir’d poor reason’s overthrow;
False in myself, thus have I lost the field.
Thus are my eyes still captive to one sight;
Thus all my thoughts are slaves to one thought still:
Thus reason to his servants yields his right;
Thus is my power transformed to your will.
What marvel then I take a woman’s hue,
Since what I see, think, know, is all but you?
   
   This ditty gave him some suspicion, but the voice gave him almost assurance who the singer was; and therefore boldly thrusting open the door and entering into the arbour, he perceived indeed that it was Pyrocles thus disguised: wherewith not receiving so much joy to have found him as grief so to have found him, amazedly looking upon him (as Apollo is painted when he saw Daphne suddenly turned into a laurel) he was not able to bring forth a word; so that Pyrocles (who had as much shame as Musidorus had sorrow) rising to him, would have formed a substantial excuse, but his insinuation" being of blushing and his division of sighs, his whole oration stood upon a short narration what was the cause of this metamorphosis. But by that time Musidorus had gathered his spirits together, and yet casting a ghastful countenance upon him as if he would conjure some strange spirit, he thus spake unto him:
   ‘And is it possible that this is Pyrocles, the only young prince in the world formed by nature and framed by education to the true exercise of virtue? Or is it indeed some Amazon that hath counterfeited the face of my friend in this sort to vex me? For likelier sure I would have thought it that any outward face might have been disguised than that the face of so excellent a mind could have been thus blemished. O sweet Pyrocles, separate yourself a little, if it be possible, from yourself, and let your own mind look upon your own proceedings; so shall my words be needless and you best instructed. See with yourself how fit it will be for you in this your tender youth, bom so great a prince, and of so rare not only expectation but proof, desired of your old father, and wanted of your native country, now so near your home to divert your thoughts from the way of goodness to lose, nay, to abuse your time. Lastly to overthrow all the excellent things you have done, which have filled the world with your fame; as if you should drown your ship in the long desired haven, or, like an ill player, should mar the last act of his tragedy. Remember (for I know you know it) that if we will be men, the reasonable part of our soul is to have absolute commandment, against which, if any sensual weakness arise, we are to yield all our sound forces to the overthrowing of so unnatural a rebellion; wherein how can we want courage, since we are to deal against so weak an adversary that in itself is nothing but weakness? Nay, we are to resolve that if reason direct it, we must do it; and if we must do it, we will do it; for, to say “I cannot,” is childish, and "I will not,” womanish.
   ‘And see how extremely every way you can endanger your uund: for to take this womanish habit, without you frame your behaviour accordingly, is wholly vain; your behaviour can never come kindly from you but as the mind is proportioned unto it: so that you must resolve, if you will play your part to any purpose, whatsoever peevish imperfections are in that sex, to soften your heart to receive them - the very first down-step to all wickedness. For do not deceive yourself, my dear cousin, there is no man suddenly either excellently good or extremely evil, but grow's either as he holds himself up in virtue or lets himself slide to viciousness.
   ‘And let us see what power is the author of all these troubles: forsooth love, love, a passion, and the basest and fruitlessest of all passions. Fear breedeth wit; anger is the cradle of courage; joy openeth and enableth the heart; sorrow, as it closeth, so it draw- eth it inward to look to the correcting of itself; and so all of them generally have power towards some good by the direction of reason. But this bastard Love (for indeed the name of love is most unworthily applied to so hateful humour) as it is engendered betwixt lust and idleness; as the matter it works upon is nothing but a certain base weakness which some gentle fools call a gentle heart; as his adjoined companions be unquietness, longings, fond comforts, faint discomforts, hopes, jealousies, ungrounded rages, causeless yieldings; so is the highest end it aspires unto a little pleasure with much pain before and great repentance after. But that end, how endless it runs to infinite evils, were fit enough for the matter we speak of; but not for your ears, in whom, indeed, there is so much true disposition to virtue.
   Yet thus much of his worthy effects in yourself is to be seen, that (besides your breaking laws of hospitality with Kalander and of friendship with me) it utterly subverts the course of nature in making reason give place to sense, and man to woman. And truly I think hereupon it first gat the name of love: for indeed the true love hath that excellent nature in it, that it doth transform the very essence of the lover into the thing loved, uniting and, as it were, incorporating it with a secret and inward working. And herein do these kinds of love imitate the excellent; for as the love of heaven makes one heavenly, the love of virtue, virtuous, so doth the love of the world make one become worldly: and this effeminate love of a woman doth so womanize a man that, if he yield to it, it will not only make him an Amazon, but a launder, a distaff-spinner or whatsoever other vile occupation their idle heads can imagine and their weak hands perform.
   ‘Therefore, to trouble you no longer with my tedious but loving words, if either you remember what you are, what you have been, or what you must be; if you consider what it is that moved you, or by what kind of creature you are moved, you shall find the cause so small, the effect so dangerous, yourself so unworthy to run into the one or to be driven by the other, that I doubt not I shall quickly have occasion rather to praise you for having conquered it than to give you further counsel how to do it.’
   But in Pyrocles this speech wrought no more but that he who(be- fore he was espied) was afraid, after (being perceived) was ashamed, now (being hardly rubbed upon) left both fear and shame and was moved to anger. But the exceeding good will he bare to Musidorus striving with it, he thus (partly to satisfy him, but principally to loose the reins to his own motions) made him answer:
   ‘Cousin, whatsoever good disposition nature hath bestowed upon me, or howsoever that disposition hath been by bringing up confirmed, this must I confess, that I am not yet come to that degree of wisdom to think light of the sex of whom I have my life, since if I be anything (which your friendship rather finds than I acknowledge) I was, to come to it, born of a woman and nursed of a woman. And certainly (for this point of your speech doth nearest touch me) it is strange to see the unmanlike cruelty of mankind, who, not content with their tyrannous ambition to have brought the other’s virtuous patience under them, like childish masters think their masterhood nothing without doing injury to them who (if we will argue by reason) are framed of nature with the same parts of the mind for the exercise of virtue as we are. And for example, even this estate of Amazons (which I now for my greatest honour do seek to counterfeit) doth well witness that if generally the sweetness of their disposition did not make them see the vainness of the.se things which we account glorious, they neither want valour of mind, nor yet doth their fairness take away their forcc. And truly we men and praisers of men should remember that if we have such excellencies, it is reason to think them excellent creatures of w'hom we are, since a kite never brought forth a good flying hawk. But to tell you true, as I think it superfluous to use any words of such a subject which is so praised in itself as it needs no praises, so withal, I fear lest my conceit (not able to reach unto them) bring forth words which for their unworthiness may be a disgrace to them I so inwardly honour. Let this suffice, that they are capable of virtue: and virtue, you yourselves say, is to be loved, and I too, truly. But this I willingly confess, that it likes me much better when I find virtue in a fair lodging than when I am bound to seek it in an ill-favoured creature, like a pearl in a dung-hill. As for my fault of being an uncivil guest to Kalander, if you could feel what an inward guest myself am host unto, you would think it very excusable, in that I rather perform the duties of an host than the ceremonies of a guest. And for my breaking the laws of friendship with you, which I would rather die than effectually do, truly I could find in my heart to ask you pardon for it but that your now handling of me gives me reason to confirm my former dealing.'
   And here Pyrocles stayed as to breathe himself, having been transported with a little vehemency, because it seemed him Musidorus had over-bitterly glanced against the reputation of womankind: but then quieting his countenance as well as out of an unquiet mind it might be, he thus proceeded on:
   ‘And poor Love,’ said he, ‘dear cousin, is little beholding unto you, since you are not contented to spoil it of the honour of the highest power of the mind which notable men have attributed unto it; but you deject it below all other passions, in truth somewhat strangely, since, if love receive any disgrace, it is by the company of these passions you prefer before it For those kinds of bitter objections (as that lust idleness, and a weak heart should be, as it were, the matter and form of love) rather touch me, dear Musidorus, than love; but I am good witness of mine own imperfections, and therefore will not defend myself. But herein I must say you deal contrary to yourself: for if I be so weak, then can you not with reason stir me up as you did by remembrance of my own virtue; or if indeed  be virtuous, then must you confess that love hath his working in a virtuous heart; and so no doubt hath it, whatsoever I be: for, if we love virtue, in whom shall we love it but in a virtuous creature - without your meaning be, I should love this word “Virtue” where I see it written in a book! Those troublesome effects you say it breeds be not the faults of love but of him that loves, as an unable vessel to bear such a liquor; like evil eyes not able to look on the sun, or like a weak brain, soonest overthrown with the best wine. Even that heavenly love you speak of is accompanied in some hearts wdth hopes, gnefs, longings and despairs. And in that heavenly love, since there are two parts - the one the love itself, the other the excellency of the thing loved — I, not able at the first leap to frame both in me, do now, like a diligent workman, make ready the chief instrument and first part of that great work, which is love itself; which when I have a while practised in this sort, then you shall see me turn it to greater matters. And thus gently you may, if it please you, think of me. Neither doubt you because I wear a woman’s apparel I will be the more womanish, since I assure you, for all my apparel, there is nothing I desire more than fully to prove myself a man in this enterprise. Much might be said in my defence, much more for love, and most of all for that divine creature which hath joined me and love together. But these disputations are fitter for quiet schools than my troubled brains, which are bent rather in deeds to perform than in words to defend the noble desire that possesseth me.’
   ‘O lord,’ said Musidorus, ‘how sharp-witted you are to hurt yourself!’
   ‘No,’ answered he, ‘but it is the hurt you speak of which makes me so sharp-witted.’
   Even so,’ said Musidorus, ‘as every base occupation makes one sharp in that practice and foolish in all the rest.’
   ‘Nay rather,’ answered Pyrocles, 'as each excellent thing, once well-learned, serves for a measure of all other knowledges.’
   'And is that become,' said Musidorus, 'a measure for other things which never received measure in itself?'
   ‘It is counted without measure,' answered Pyrocles, ‘because the workings of it are without measure; but otherwise, in nature it hath measure, since it hath an end allotted unto it.'
   ‘The beginning being so excellent,’ said Musidorus, ‘I would gladly know the end.'
   'Enjoying,' answered Pyrocles with a deep sigh.
   ‘O,’ said Musidnrus, ‘now set you forth the baseness of it, since if it end in enjoying, it shows all the rest was nothing.’
   ‘You mistake me,' answered Pyrocles, ‘I spake of the end to which it is directed; which end ends not, no sooner than the life.’ ‘Alas, let your own brain disenchant you,’ said Musidorus.
   ‘My heart is too far possessed,’ said Pyrocles.
   ‘But the head gives you direction, ’said Musidorus.
   ‘And the heart gives me life,’ answered Pyrocles.
   But Musidorus was so grieved to see his well-beloved friend obstinate, as he thought, to his own destruction, that it forced him with more than accustomed vehemency to speak these words.
   'Well, well,’ said he, ‘you list to abuse yourself. It was a very white and red virtue which you could pick out of a painterly gloss of a visage. Confess the truth, and you shall find the utmost was but beauty, a thing, which though it be in as great excellency in yourself as may be in any, yet I am sure you make no further reckoning of it than of an outward fading benefit Nature bestowed upon you. And yet such is your want of a true grounded virtue, which must be like itself in all points, that what you wisely account a trifle in yourself, you fondly become a slave unto in another. For my part I how protest I have left nothing unsaid which my wit could make me know, or my most entire friendship to you requires of me. I do now beseech you even for the love betwixt us (if this other love have left any in you towards me) and for the remembrance of your old careful father (if you can remember him that forget yourself) lastly, for Pyrocles’ own sake (who is now upon the point of falling or rising) to purge yourself of this vile infection. Otherwise give me leave to leave off this name of friendship as an idle title of a thing which cannot be where virtue is abolished.’
   The length of these speeches before had not so much cloyed Pyrocles, though he were very impatient of long deliberations, as this last farewell of him he loved as his own life did wound his soul. For thinking himself afilicted, he was the apter to conceive unkindness deeply; insomuch that shaking his head, and delivering some show of tears, he thus uttered his griefs:
   ‘Alas,’ said he, Trince Musidorus, how cruelly you deal with me. If you seek the victory, take it, and, if you list, the triumph. Have you all the reason of the world, and with me remain all the imperfections, yet such as I can no more lay from me than the crow can be persuaded by the swan to cast off all his black feathers. But truly you deal with me like a physician that, seeing his patient in a pestilent fever, should chide him instead of ministering help, and bid him be sick no more; or rather like such a friend that, visiting his friend condemned to perpetual prison and laden with grievous fetters, should will him to shake off his fetters or he would leave him. I am sick, and sick to the death. I am prisoner, neither is there any redress but by her to whom I am a slave. Now, if you list, leave him that loves you in the highest degree: but remember ever to carry this with you, that you abandon your friend in his greatest extremity.’
   And herewith the deep wound of his love, being rubbed afresh with this new unkindness, began, as it were, to bleed again in such sort that he was unable to bear it any longer; but gushing out abundance of tears, and crossing his arms over his woeful heart, as if his tears had been out-flowing blood, his arms an overpressing burden, he sunk down to the ground. Which sudden trance went so to the heart of Musidorus that, falling down by him and kissing the weeping eyes of his friend, he besought him not to make account of his speech which, if it had been over- vehement, yet was it to be borne withal, because it came out of a love much more vehement: that he had not thought fancy could have received so deep a wound; but now finding in him the force of it, he would no further contrary it but employ all his service to medicine it in such sort as the nature of it required. But even this kindness made Pyrocles the more melt in the former unkindness, which his manlike tears well showed, with a silent look upon Musidorus, as who should say: ‘And is it possible that Musidorus should threaten to leave me?'; and this struck Musidorus’ mind and senses so dumb, too, that for grief being not able to say anything, they rested with their eyes placed one upon another, in such sort as might well paint out the true passion of unkindness to be never aright but betwixt them that most dearly love.
   And thus remained they a time, till at length Musidorus, embracing him, said And will you thus shake off your friend?’
   ‘It is you that shake me off,’ said Pyrocles, ‘being for my unperfectness unworthy of your friendship.’
   ‘But this,’ said Musidorus, ‘shows you more unperfect, to be cruel to him that submits himself unto you. But since you are unperfect,’ said he, smiling, ‘it is reason you be governed by us wise and perfect men. And that authority will I begin to take upon me with three absolute commandments: the first, that you increase not your evil with further griefs: the second, that you love her with all the powers of your mind: and the last commandment shall be, you command me to do what service I can towards the attaining of your desires.’
   Pyrocles’ heart was not so oppressed with the two mighty passions of love and unkindness but that it yielded to some mirth at this commandment of Musidorus that he should love; so that something clearing his face from his former shows of grief: ‘Well/ said he, ‘dear cousin, I see by the well choosing of your commandments that you are far fitter to be a prince than a counsellor, and therefore I am resolved to employ all my endeavour to obey you, with this condition, that the commandments you command me to lay upon you shall only be, that you continue to love me, and look upon my imperfections with more affection than judgement.’
   ‘Love you?’ said he. ‘Alas, how can my heart be separated from the true embracing of it without it burst by being too full of it? But/ said he, ‘let us leave off these flowers of new begun friendship: and now I pray you again tell me, but tell it me fully, omitting no circumstance, the story of your affections, both beginning and proceeding, assuring yourself that there is nothing so great which I will fear to do for you, nor nothing so small which I will disdain to do for you. Let me, therefore, receive a clear understanding, which many times we miss while those things we account small, as a speech or a look, are omitted, like as a whole sentence may fail of his congruity by wanting one particle. Therefore between friends all must be laid open, nothing being superfluous nor tedious.’
   ‘You shall be obeyed,’ said Pyrocles, ‘and here are we in as fit a place for it as may be; for this arbour nobody offers to come into but myself, I using it as my melancholy retiring place, and therefore that respect is borne unto it. Yet if by chance any should corns, say that you are a servant sent from the queen of the Amazons to seek me, and then let me alone for the rest.’ So sat they down, and Pyrocles thus said.
   CHAPTER 13
   ‘Cousin,’ said he, ‘then began the fatal overthrow of all my liberty when, walking among the pictures in Kalander’s house, you yourself delivered unto me what you had understood of Philoclea; who much resembling (though I must say much surpassing) the lady Zelmane whom so well I loved, there were mine eyes infected, and at your mouth did I drink my poison. Yet alas, so sweet was it unto me, that I could not be contented till Kalander had made it more and more strong with his declaration. Which the more I questioned, the more pity I conceived of her unworthy fortune; and when with pity once my heart was made tender, according to the aptness of the humour, it received quickly a cruel impression of that wonderful passion which to be defined is impossible, because no words reach to the strange nature of it. They only know it, which inwardly feel it: it is called love.
   ‘Yet did I not, poor wretch, at first know my disease, thinking it only such a wonted kind of desire to see rare sights, and my pity to be no other but the fruits of a gentle nature. But even this arguing with myself came of further thoughts, and the more I argued the more my thoughts increased. Desirous I was to see the place where she remained, as though the architecture of the lodges would have been much for my learning; but more desirous to see herself, to be judge, forsooth, of the painter’s cunning - for thus at the first did I flatter myself, as though my wound had been no deeper. But when within short time I came to the degree of uncertain wishes and that those wishes grew to unquiet longings; when I could fix my thoughts upon nothing but that within little varying they should end with Philoclea; when each thing I saw seemed to figure out some part of my passions; when even Par- thenia's fair face became a lecture to me of Philoclea’s imagined beauty; when I heard no word spoken but that methought it carried the sound of Philoclea’s name; then, indeed, then I did yield to the burden, finding myself prisoner before I had leisure to arm myself, and that I might well, like the spaniel, gnaw upon the chain that ties him, but I should sooner mar my teeth than procure liberty.
   ‘Yet I take to witness the eternal spring of virtue that I had never read, heard nor seen anything, I had never any taste of philosophy nor inward feeling in myself which for a while I did not call to my succour. But, alas, what resistance was there, when ere long my very reason was, you will say, corrupted - must confess, conquered - and that methought even reason did assure me that all eyes did degenerate from their creation which did not honour such beauty? Nothing in truth could hold any plea with it but the reverend friendship I bare unto you. For as it went against my heart to break anyway from you, so did I fear, more than any assault, to break it to you; finding (as it is indeed) that to a heart fully resolute, counsel is tedious but reprehension is loathsome, and that there is nothing more terrible to a guilty heart than the eye of a respected friend. This made me determine with myself (thinking it a less fault in friendship to do a thing without your knowledge than against your will) to take this secret course: which conceit was most builded up in me the last day of my parting and speaking with you, when upon your speech with me and my but naming love, when else perchance I would have gone further, I saw your voice and countenance so change as it assured me my revealing it should but purchase your grief with my cumber; and therefore, dear Musidorus, even ran away from thy well-known chiding. For having written a letter, which I know not whether you found or no, and taking my chief jewels with me, while you were in the midst of your sport I got a time, as I think, unmarked by any, to steal away I cared not whither so I might escape you.
   ‘And so came I to Ithonia in the province of Messenia, where, lying secret, I put this in practice which before I had devised. For remembering by Philanax’s letter and Kalander's speech how obstinately Basilius was determined not to marry his daughters, and therefore fearing lest any public dealing should rather increase her captivity than further my love, love (the refiner of invention) had put in my head thus to disguise myself that under that mask I might, if it were possible, get access; and what access could bring forth commit to fortune and industry, determining to bear the countenance of an Amazon. Therefore in the closest manner I could, naming myself Zelmane for that dear lady’s sake to whose memory I am so much bound, I caused this apparel to be made, and bringing it near the lodges which are hard at hand, by night thus dressed myself, resting till occasion might make me to be found by them whom I sought; which the next morning happened as well as my own plot could have laid it. For after I had run over the whole pedigree of my thoughts, I gave myself to sing a little, which, as you know, I ever delighted in, so now especially - whether it be the nature of this clime to stir up poetical fancies, or rather as I think, of love, whose scope, being pleasure, will not so much as utter his griefs but in some form of pleasure.
   ‘But I had sung very little, when (as I think, displeased with my bad music) comes master Dametas with a hedging bill in his hand, chafing and swearing by the pantable of Pallas and such other oaths as his rustical bravery could imagine; and when he saw me, I assure you my beauty was no more beholding to him than my harmony; for leaning his hands upon his bill and his chin upon his hands, with the voice of one that playeth Hercules in a play but never had his fancy in his head, the first word he spake to me was, “Am not I Dametas? Why, am not I Dametas?”
   ‘He needed not name himself, for Kalander’s description had set such a note upon him as made him very notable unto me; and therefore the height of my thoughts would not descend so much as to make him any answer, but continued on my inward discourses; which he (perchance witness of his own unworthiness, and therefore the apter to think himself contemned) took in so heinous manner, that standing upon his tiptoes, and staring as if he would have had a mote pulled out of his eye, “Why,” said he, “thou woman, or boy, or both, whatsoever thou be, I tell thee here is no place for thee, get thee gone. I tell thee it is the prince’s pleasure; I tell thee it is Dametas’ pleasure.”
   ‘I could not choose but smile at him, seeing him look so like an ape that had newly taken a purgation; yet taking myself with the manner, spake these words to myself: “O spirit,” said I, “of mine, how canst thou receive any mirth in the midst of thine agonies? And thou, mirth, how darest thou enter into a mind so grown of late thy professed enemy?”
   “Thy spirit!” said Dametas,“Dost thou think me a spirit? I tell thee I am Basilius’ officer, and have charge of him and his daughters.”
   ‘ “O only pearl,” said I, sobbing, “that so vile an oyster should keep thee!”
    “By the comb case of Diana,” sware Dametas, “this woman is mad. Oysters and pearls! Dost thou think I will buy oysters? I tell thee once again, get thee packing,” and with that lifted up his bill to hit me with the blunt end of it; but indeed that put me quite out of my lesson, so that I forgot all Zelmaneship, and drawing out my sword, the baseness of the villain yet made me stay my hand; and he - who, as Kalander told me, from his childhood ever feared the blade of a sword - ran backward with his hands above his head at least twenty paces, gaping and staring with the very grace, I think, of the clowns that by Latona’s prayers were turned into frogs.
   ‘At length staying, finding himself without the compass of blows, he fell to a fresh scolding, in such mannerly manner as might well show he had passed through the discipline of a tavem. But seeing me walk up and down without marking what he said, he went his way, as I perceived after, to Basilius; for within a while he came unto me, bearing indeed shows in his countenance of an honest and well-minded gentleman, and with as much courtesy as Dametas with rudeness saluting me:
   ‘ “Fair lady,” said he, "it is nothing strange that such a solitary place as this should receive solitary persons, but much do I marvel how such a beauty as yours is should be suffered to be thus alone.”
   ‘I, that now knew it was my part to play, looking with a grave majesty upon him, as if I found in myself cause to be reverenced, “They are never alone,” said I, "that are accompanied with noble thoughts.”
    “But those thoughts,” replied Basilius, “cannot in this your loneliness neither warrant you from suspicion in others nor defend you from melancholy in yourself.”
   ‘I then showing a mislike that he pressed me so far, “I seek np better warrant,” said I, “than my own conscience, nor no greater pleasure than my own contentation.”
    "Yet virtue seeks to satisfy others,” said Basilius.
    “Those that be good,” said I, “and they will be satisfied as long as they see no evil”
    “Yet will the best in this country,” said Basilius, “suspect so excellent beauty being so weakly guarded.”
   ‘ “Then are the best but stark naught,” answered I, "for open suspecting others comes of secret condemning themselves. But in my country, whose manners I am in all places to maintain and reverence, the general goodness which is nourished in our hearts makes every one think the strength of virtue in another whereof they find the assured foundation in themselves.”
   ' “Excellent lady,” said he, "you praise so greatly, and yet so wisely, your country that I must needs desire to know what the nest is out of which such birds do fly.”
    “You must first deserve it,” said I, "before you may obtain it”
   ‘ “And by what means,” said Basilius, "shall I deserve to know your estate?”
   ‘ “By letting me first know yours,” answered I.
    "To obey you,” said he, "I will do it; although it were so much more reason yours should be known first, as you do deserve in all points to be preferred. Know you, fair lady, that my name is Basilius, unworthily lord of this country. The rest, either fame hath already brought to your ears or (if it please you to make this place happy by your presence) at more leisure you shall understand of me.”
   ‘I that from the beginning assured myself it was he, but would not seem I did so, to keep my gravity the better, making a piece of reverence unto him, "Mighty prince,” said I, "let my not knowing you serve for the excuse of my boldness; and the little reverence I do you, impute it to the manner of my country, which is the invincible land of the Amazons: myself niece to Senicia, queen thereof, lineally descended of the famous Penthesilea slain by the bloody hand of Pyrrhus. I, having in this my youth determined to make the world see the Amazons’ excellencies as well in private as in public virtue, have passed some dangerous adventures in divers countries till the unmerciful sea deprived me of my company; so that shipwreck casting me not far hence, uncertain wandering brought me to this place.”
   'But Basilius (who now began to taste of that, which since he hath swallowed up, as I will tell you) fell to more cunning entreating my abode than any greedy host would use to well-paying passengers. I thought nothing could shoot Tighter at the mark of my desires; yet had I learned already so much, that it was against my womanhood to be forward in my own wishes. And therefore he (to prove whether intercessions in fitter mouths might better prevail) commanded Dametas to bring forthwith his wife and daughters thither; three ladies, although of diverse, yet all of excellent beauty.
   'His wife in grave matron-like attire, with countenance and gesture suitable and of such fairness (being in the strength of her age) as (if her daughters had not been by) might with just price have purchased admiration; but they being there, it was enough that the most dainty eye would think her a worthy mother of such children. The fair Pamela, whose noble heart I find doth greatly disdain that the trust of her virtue is reposed in such a lout's hands as Dametas, had yet, to show an obedience, taken on shep herdish apparel, which was but of russet-cloth cut after their fashion, with a straight body, open breasted, the nether part full of pleats, with long and wide sleeves: but believe me she did apparel her apparel, and with the preciousness of her body made it most sumptuous. Her hair at the full length wound about with gold lace, only by the comparison to show how far her hair doth excel in colour: betwixt her breasts, which sweetly rase up like two fair mountainets in the pleasant vale of Tempe, there hung a very rich diamond set but in a black horn; the word I have since read is this: “Yet still myself.” And thus particularly have I described them, because you may know that mine eyes are not so partial but that I marked them too.
   ‘But when the ornament of the earth, the model of heaven, the triumph of Nature, the life of beauty, the queen of love, young Philoclea appeared in her nymph-like apparel, so near nakedness as one might well discern part of her perfections, and yet so apparelled as did show she kept best store of her beauty to herself: her hair (alas, too poor a word! Why should I not rather call them her beams!) drawn up into a net, able to have caught Jupiter when he was in the form of an eagle; her body (O sweet body!) covered with a light taffeta garment, so cut as the wrought smock came through it in many places, enough to have made your restrained imagination have thought what was under it: with the cast of her black eyes - black indeed, whether nature so made them that we might be the more able to behold and bear their wonderful shining, or that she, goddess-like, would work this miracle with herself in giving blackness the price above all beauty - then, I say, indeed methought the lilies grew pale for envy; the roses methought blushed to see sweeter roses in her cheeks, and the apples methought fell down from the trees to do homage to the apples of her breast. Then the clouds gave place that the heavens might more freely smile upon her - at the least the clouds of my thoughts quite vanished, and my sight, then more clear and forcible than ever, was so fixed there that, I imagine, I stood like a well-wrought image with some life in show but none in practice. And so had I been like enough to have stayed long time but that Gynecia stepping between my sight and the only Philoclea, the change of object made me recover my senses so that I could with reasonable good manner receive the salutation of her and of the Princess Pamela, doing them yet no further reverence than one princess useth to another. But when I came to the never-enough praised Philoclea, I could not but fall down on my knees, and taking by force her hand and kissing it, I must confess, with more than womanly ardency, “Divine lady,” Sid I, “let not the world nor these great princesses marvel to see me, contrary to my manner, do this especial honour unto you, since all, both men and women, do owe tliis to the perfection of your beauty.”
   ‘But she, blushing like a fair morning in May at this my singularity, and causing me to rise, “Noble lady,” said she, “it is no marvel to see your judgement much mistaken in my beauty, since you begin with so great an error as to do more honour unto me than to them to w'hom I myself owe all service.”
   ‘ “Rather,” answered I with a bowed down countenance, "that shows the power of your beauty which forced me to do such an error, if it were an error.”
   ‘ “You are so well acquainted,” said she sw'eetly, most sweetly smiling, “with your own beauty that it makes you easily fall into the discourse of beauty.”
   ‘ “Beauty in me?” said I, truly sighing, “Alas, if there be any it is in my eyes, which your blessed presence hath imparted unto them.”
   ‘But then, as I think, Basilius willing her so to do, “Well,” said she, “ must needs confess I have heard that it is a great happiness to be praised of them that are most praiseworthy, and well I find that you are an invincible Amazon since you will overcome, though in a wrong matter. But if my beauty be anything, then let it obtain thus much of you, that you will remain some while in this company to ease your own travail and our solitariness.”
   ‘ “First let me die,” said I, “before any word spoken by such a mouth should come in vain.”
   ‘And thus with some other words of entertaining was my staying concluded, and I led among them to the lodge: truly a place for pleasantness, not unfit to flatter solitariness; for it being set upon such an unsensible rising of the ground as you are come to a pretty height before almost you perceive that you ascend, it gives the eye lordship over a good large circuit, which according to the nature of the country, being diversified between hills and dales, woods and plains, one place more clear, another more darksome, it seems a pleasant picture of nature, with lovely lightsomeness and artificial shadows. The lodge is of a yellow stone, built in the form of a star, having round about a garden framed into like points; and beyond the garden, ridings cut out, each answering the angles of the lodge. At the end of one of them is the other smaller lodge but of like fashion, where the gracious Pamela liveth, so that the lodge seemeth not unlike a fair comet, whose tail stretcheth itself to a star of less greatness.’
   CHAPTER 14
   ‘So Gynecia herself bringing me to my lodging, anon after, I was invited and brought down to sup with them in the garden, a place not fairer in natural ornaments than artificial inventions, wherein is a banqueting-house among certain pleasant trees, whose heads seemed curled with the wrappings about of vine branches. The table was set near to an excellent water-work; for by the casting of the water in most cunning manner, it makes, with the shining of the sun upon it, a perfect rainbow, not more pleasant to the eye than to the mind so sensibly to see the proof of the heavenly Iris. There were birds also made so finely that they did not only deceive the sight with their figure, but the hearing with their songs which the watery instruments did make their gorge deliver. The table at which we sat was round, which being fast to the floor whereon we sat, and that divided from the rest of the buildings, with turning a vice - which Basilius at first did to make me sport - the table and we about the table did all turn round by means of water which ran under and carried it about as a mill. But alas, what pleasure did it to me to make divers times the full circle round about, since Philoclea, being also set, was carried still in equal distance from me, and that only my eyes did overtake her, which (when the table was stayed and we began to feed) drank much more eagerly of her beauty than my mouth did of any other liquor. And so was my common sense deceived, being chiefly bent to her, that as I drank the wine and withal stole a look on her, me seemed I tasted her deliciousness. But alas, the one thirst was much more inflamed than the other quenched. Sometimes my eyes would lay themselves open to receive all the darts she did throw, sometimes close up with admiration, as if with a contrary fancy they would preserve the riches of that sight they had gotten, or cast my lids as curtains over the image of beauty her presence had painted in them. True it is that my reason, now’ grown a servant to passion, did yet often tell his master that he should more moderately use his delight. But he, that of a rebel was become a prince, disdained almost to allow him the place of a counsellor; so that my senses’ delights being too strong for any other resolution, I did even loose the reins ur.to them, hoping that going for a woman, my looks would pass either unmarked or unsuspected.
   'Now thus I had, as methought, well played my first act, as suring myself that under that disguisement I should find opportunity to reveal myself to the owner of my heart But who would think it possible (though I feel it true) that in almost eight weeks’ space I have lived here (having no more company but her parents, and I being familiar as being a woman, and watchful as being a lover) yet could never find opportunity to have one minute's leisure of private conference: the cause whereof is as strange as the effects are to me miserable. And, alas, this it is.
   'At the first sight that Basilius had of me (I think Cupid having headed his arrows with my misfortune) he wras stricken (taking me to be such as I profess) with great affection towards me, which since is grown to such a doting love that till I was fain to get this place sometimes to retire unto freely, I was even choked with his tediousness. You never saw four score years dance up and down more lively in a young lover, now as fine in his apparel as if he would make me in love with a cloak, and verse for verse with the sharpest-witted lover in Arcadia. Do you not think that this is a sallet of wormwood while mine eyes feed upon the ambrosia of Philoclea’s beauty?
   ‘But this is not all; no, this is not the worst: for he, good man, were easy enough to be dealt with; but (as I think) love and mischief, having made a wager which should have most power in me, have set Gynecia also on such a fire towards me as will never, I fear, be quenched but with my destruction. For she, being a woman of excellent wit and of strong-working thoughts, whether she suspected me by my over-vehement shows of aflection to Philoclea (which love forced me unwisely to utter, while hope of my mask foolishly encouraged me) or that she hath taken some other mark of me that I am not a woman, or what devil it is hath revealed it unto her, I know not; but so it is, that all her countenances, words, and gestures are even miserable portraitures of a desperate affection. Whereby a man may learn that these avoidings of company do but make the passions more violent when they meet with fit subjects. Truly it were a notable dumb show of Cupid’s kingdom to see my eyes, languishing with over-vehement longing, direct themselves to Philoclea; and Basilius, as busy about me as a bee and indeed as cumbersome, making such vehement suits to me, who neither could if I would nor would if I could, help him; while the terrible wit of Gynecia, carried with the beer of violent love, runs through us all. And so jealous is she of my love to her daughter that I could never yet begin to open my mouth to the unevitable Philoclea but that her unwished presence gave my tale a conclusion before it had a beginning.
   ‘And surely, if I be not deceived, I see such shows of liking and, if I be acquainted with passions, of almost a passionate liking in the heavenly Philoclea towards me, that I may hope her ears would not abhor my discourse. And for good Basilius, he thought it best to have lodged us together, but that the eternal hatefulness of my destiny made Gynecia’s jealousy stop that and all other my blessings. Yet must I confess that one way her love doth me pleasure, for since it was my foolish fortune or unfortunate folly to be known by her, that keeps her from betraying me to Basilius. And thus, my Musidorus, you have my tragedy played unto you by myself, which I pray the gods may not indeed prove a tragedy.' And therewith he ended, making a full point of a hearty sigh.
   Musidorus recommended to his best discourse, all which Pyrocles had told him, but therein he found such intricateness that lie could see no way to lead him out of the maze. Yet perceiving his aflection so grounded that striving against it did rather anger than heal the wound, and rather call his friendship in question than give place to any friendly counsel, ‘Well,’ said he, ‘dear cousin, since it hath pleased the gods to mingle your other excellencies with this humour of love, yet happy it is that your love is employed upon so rare a woman; for certainly a noble cause doth ease much a grievous case. But as it stands now, nothing vexeth me so much as that I cannot see wherein I can be serviceable unto you.'
   ‘I desire no greater service of you,’ answered Pyrocles, ‘than that you remain secretly in this country, and sometimes come to this place, cither late in the night or early in the morning, where you shall have my key to enter, because as my fortune either amends or impairs, I may declare it unto you and have your counsel and furtherance. And hereby I will of purpose lead her, that is the praise and yet the stain of all womankind, that you may have so good a view as to allow my judgement; and as I can get the most convenient time, I will come unto you; for, though by reason of yonder wood you cannot see the lodge, it is hard at hand. But now,' said she, ‘it is time for me to leave you, and towards evening we will walk out of purpose hitherward: therefore keep yourself close in that time.’
   But Musidorus, bethinking himself that his horse might happen to betray them, thought it best to return for that day to a village not far off, and dispatching his horse in some sort, the next day early to come a foot thither, and so to keep that course afterwards, which Pyrocles very well liked of.
   ‘Now farewell, dear cousin,' said he, ‘from me, no more Pyrocles nor Daiphantus now, but Zelmane. Zelmane is my name; Zelmane is my title; Zelmane is the only hope of my advancement.' And with that word going out and seeing that the coast was clear, Zelmane dismissed Musidorus, w'ho departed as full of care to help his friend as before he was to dissuade him.
   CHAPTER  15
   
   Zelmane returned to the lodge, where (inflamed by Philoclea, watched by Gynecia, and tired by Basilius) she was like a horse desirous to run and miserably spurred, but so short reined as he cannot stir forward. Zelmane sought occasion to speak with Philoclea, Basilius with Zelmane, and Gynecia hindered them all. If Philoclea happened to sigh (and sigh she did often) as if that sigh were to be waited on, Zelmane sighed also; whereto Basilius and Gynecia soon made up four parts of sorrow. Their affection increased their conversation, and their conversation increased their affection. The respect borne bred due ceremonies, but the affection shined so through them that the ceremonies seemed not ceremonious. Zelmane’s eyes were (like children before sweetmeat) eager, brt fearful of their ill-pleasing governors. Time, in one instant, seeming both short and long unto them: short, in the pleasingness of such presence; long, in the stay of their desires.
   But Zelmane failed not to entice them all many times abroad because she was desirous her friend Musidorus (near whom of purpose she led them) might have full sight of them; sometimes angling to a little river near hand, which, for the moisture it bestowed upon the roots of some flourishing trees, was rewarded with their shadow. There would they sit down, and pretty wagers be made between Pamela and Philoclea which could soonest beguile silly fishes, while Zelmane protested that the fit prey for them was hearts of princes. She also had an angle in her hand, but the taker was so taken that she had forgotten taking. Basilius in the meantime would be the cook himself of what was so caught, and Gynecia sit still, but with no still pensiveness. Now she brought them to see a seeled dove, who, the blinder she was, the higher she strave. Another time a kite, which having a gut cunningly pulled out of her and so let fly, called all the kites in that quarter, who (as oftentimes the world is deceived) thinking her prosperous when indeed she was wounded, made the poor kite find that opinion of riches may well be dangerous. 
   But these recreations were interrupted by a delight of a more gallant show; for one evening, as Basilius returned from having forced his thoughts to please themselves in such small conquests, there came a shepherd who brought him word that a gentleman desired leave to do a message from his lord unto him. Basilius granted; whereupon the gentleman came, and after the dutiful ceremonies observed in his master’s name, told him that he was sent from Phalantus of Corinth to crave licence that, as he had done in many other courts, so he might in his presence defy all Arcadian knights in the behalf of his mistress' beauty who would, besides, herself in person be present to give evident proof what his lance should affirm. The conditions of his challenge were that the defendant should bring his mistress’ picture, which being set by the image of Artesia (so was the mistress of Phalantus named), who in six courses should have better of the other in the judgement of Basilius, with him both the honours and the pictures should remain. Basilius, though he had retired himself into that solitary dwelling with intention to avoid rather than to accept any matters of drawing company, yet because he would entertain Zelmane that she might not think the time so gainful to him loss to her, granted him to pitch his tents for three days not far from the lodge, and to proclaim his challenge that what Arcadian knight (for none else but upon his peril was licensed to come) would defend what he honoured against Phalantus should have the like freedom of access and return.
   This obtained and published, Zelmane being desirous to leam what this Phalantus was, having never known him further than by report of his good jousting, in so much as he was commonly called ‘The fair man of arms’; Basilius told her that he had had occasion by one very inward with him to know in part the discourse of his life, which was, that he was bastard brother to the fair Helen queen of Corinth, and dearly esteemed of her for his exceeding good parts, being honourably courteous and wrong- lessly valiant, considerately pleasant in conversation, and an excellent courtier without unfaithfulness; who (finding his sisters unpersuadable melancholy through the love of Amphialus) had for a time left her court and gone into Laconia, where, in the war against the Helots, he had gotten the reputation of one that both durst and knew. But as it was rather choice than nature that led him to matters of arms, so as soon as the spur of honour ceased, he willingly rested in peaceable delights, being beloved in all companies for his lovely qualities and (as a man may term it) winning cheerfulness; whereby to the prince and court of Laconia, none was more agreeable than Phalantus: and he, not given greatly to struggle with his own disposition, followed the gentle current of it, having a fortune sufficient to content, and he content with a sufficient fortune.
   ‘But in that court he saw and was acquainted with this Artesia whose beauty he now defends; became her servant; said himself (and perchance thought himself) her lover. But certainly,’ said Basilius, ‘many times it falls out that these young companions make themselves believe they love at the first liking of a likely beauty; loving, because they will love for want of other business, not because they feel indeed that divine power which makes the heart find a reason in passion, and so, God knows, as inconstantly leave upon the next chance that beauty casts before them. So therefore taking love upon him like a fashion, he courted this lady Artesia, who was as fit to pay him in his own money as might be; for she, thinking she did wrong to her beauty if she were not proud of it, called her disdain of him chastity, and placed her honour in little setting by his honouring her; determining never to marry but him whom she thought worthy of her, and that was one in whom all worthinesses were harboured. And to this conceit not only nature had bent her, but the bringing-up she received at my sister-in-law Cecropia had confirmed her; who, having in her widowhood taken this young Artesia into her charge because her father had been a dear friend of her dear husband’s, had taught her to think that there is no wisdom but in including both heaven and earth in oneself; and that love, courtesy, gratefulness, friendship, and all other virtues are rather to be taken on than taken in oneself. And so good a disciple she found of her that, liking the fruits of her own planting, she was content (if so her son could have liked of it) to have wished her in marriage to my nephew Amphialus. But I think that desire hath lost some of his heat since she hath known that such a queen as Helen is doth offer so great a price as a kingdom to buy his favour; for, if I be not deceived in my good sister Cecropia, she thinks no face so beautiful as that which looks under a crown.
   ‘But Artesia indeed liked well of my nephew Amphialus - for I can never deem that love which in haughty hearts proceeds of a desire only to please and, as it were, peacock themselves: but yet she hath showed vehemency of desire that way, I think, because all her desires be vehement, insomuch that she hath both placed her only brother (a fine youth called Ismenus) to be his 'squire, and herself is content to wait upon my sister till she may see the uttermost what she may work in Amphialus: who being of a melancholy (though, I must say, truly courteous and noble) mind, seems to love nothing less than love; and of late, having through some adventure or inward miscontentment withdrawn himself from anybody’s knowledge where he is, Artesia the easier condescended to go to the court of Laconia, whither she was sent for by the king’s wife to whom she is somewhat allied.
   ‘And there, after the war of the Helots, this knight Phalantus, at least for tongue-delight, made himself her servant, and she, so little caring as not to show mislike thereof, was content only to be noted to have a notable servant. For truly one in my court, nearly acquainted with him, within these few days made me a pleasant description of their love, while he with cheerful looks would speak sorrowful words, using the phrase of his affection in so high a style that Mercury would not have wooed Venus with more magnificent eloquence; but else, neither in behaviour nor action accusing in himself any great trouble in mind whether he sped or no. And she, of the other side, well finding how little it Was and not caring for more, yet taught him that often it falleth out but a foolish wittiness to speak more than one thinks.
   ‘For she made earnest benefit of his jest, forcing him in respect of his profession to do her such services as were both cumbersome and costly unto him, while he still thought he went beyond her because his heart did not commit the idolatry. So that lastly she, I think, having in mind to make the fame of her beauty an orator for her to Amphialus (persuading herself, perhaps, that it might falJ out in him as it doth in some that have delightful meat before them, and have no stomach to it before other folks praise it) she took the advantage one day, upon Phalantus’ unconscionable praisings of her and certain cast-away vows how much he would do for her sake, to arrest his word as soon as it was out of his mouth, and by the virtue thereof to charge him to go with her through all the courts of Greece, and with the challenge now made to give her beauty the principality over all other. Phalantus was entrapped, and saw round about him but could not get out. Exceedingly perplexed he was, as he confessed to him that told me the tale, not for doubt he had of himself (for indeed he had little cause, being accounted, with his lance especially, whereupon the challenge is to be tried, as perfect as any that Greece knoweth) but because he feared to offend his sister Helen; and withal, as he said, he could not so much believe his love but that he must think in his heart (whatsoever his mouth affirmed) that both she, my daughters, and the fair Parthenia (wife to a most noble gentleman, my wife’s near kinsman) might far better put in their claim for that prerogative. But his promise had bound him prentice, and therefore it was now better with willingness to purchase thanks than with a discontented doing to have the pain and not the reward; and therefore went on as his faith rather than love did lead him.
   And now hath he already passed the courts of Laconia, Elis, Argos, and Corinth. And, as many times it happens that a good pleader makes a bad cause to prevail, so hath his lance brought captives to the triumph of Artesia’s beauty such as, though Artesia be among the fairest, yet in that company were to have the pre-eminence: for in those courts many knights that had been in other far countries defended such as they had seen and liked in their travel; but their defence had been such as they had forfeited the pictures of their ladies to give a forced false testimony to Artesia’s excellency. And now, lastly, is he come hither, where he hath leave to try his fortune. But I assure you, if I thought it not in due and true consideration an injurious service and churlish courtesy to put the danger of so noble a title in the deciding of such a dangerless combat, I would make young master Phalantus know that your eyes can sharpen a blunt lance, and that age (which my grey hairs, only gotten by the loving care of others, make seem more than it is) hath not diminished in me the power to protect an undeniable verity.'
   With that he bustled up himself, as though his heart would fain have walked abroad. Zelmane with an inward smiling gave him outward thanks, desiring him to reserve his force for worthier causes.
   
   CHAPTER 16
   So passing their time according to their wont, they waited for the coming of Phalantus, who the next morning, having already caused his tents to be pitched near to a fair tree hard by the lodge, had upon the tree made a shield to be hanged up, which the defendant should strike that would call him to the maintaining his challenge. The impresa in the shield was a heaven full of stars, with a speech signifying that it was the beauty which gave it the praise. Himself came in next after a triumphant chariot made of camation-velvet enriched with purl and pearl, wherein Artesia sat, drawn by four winged horses with artificial flaming mouths and fiery wings, as if she had newly borrowed them of Phoebus. Before her marched, two after two, certain footmen pleasantly attired, who between them held one picture after another of them that by Phalantus’ well running had lost the prize in the race of beauty, and at every pace they stayed, turning the pictures to each side so leisurely that with perfect judgement they might be discerned.
   The first that came in, following the order of the time wherein they had been won, was the picture of Andromana, queen of Iberia, whom a Laconian knight (having some time and with special favour served, though some years since returned home) with more gratefulness than good fortune defended. But therein Fortune had borrowed wit; for indeed she was not comparable to Artesia, not because she was a good deal older (for time had not yet been able to impoverish her store thereof) but an exceeding red hair with small eyes did, like ill companions, disgrace the other assembly of most commendable beauties.
   Next after her was borne the counterfeit of the Princess of Elis, a lady that taught the beholders no other point of beauty but this: that as liking is not always the child of beauty, so whatsoever liketh is beautiful; for in that visage there was neither majesty, grace, favour, nor fairness; yet she wanted not a servant that would have made her fairer than the fair Artesia. But he wrote her praises with his helmet in the dust, and left her picture to be as true a witness of his overthrow as his running was of her beauty.
   After her was the goodly Artaxia, great queen of Armenia, a lady upon whom nature bestowed and well placed her most delightful colours, and, withal, had proportioned her without any fault quickly to be discovered by the senses; yet all together seemed not to make up that harmony that Cupid delights in; the reason whereof might seem a mannish countenance which overthrew that lovely sweetness, the noblest power of womankind, far fitter to prevail by parley than by battle.
   Of a far contrary consideration was the representation of her that next followed, which was Erona queen of Lyria, who though of so brown a hair as no man should have injured it to have called it black, and that in the mixture of her cheeks the white did so much overcome the red - though what was, was very pure - that it came near to paleness, and that her face was a thought longer than the exact symmetrians perhaps would allow; yet love played his part so well in every part that it caught hold of the judgement before it could judge, making it first love, and after acknowledge it fair; for there was a certain delicacy which in yielding conquered, and with a pitiful look made one find cause to crave help himself.
   After her came two ladies of noble but not of royal birth. The former was named Baccha, who though very fair, and of a fatness rather to allure than to mislike, yet her breasts over-familiarly laid open, with a made countenance about her mouth between simpering and smiling, her head bowed somewhat down, seemed to languish with over-much idleness, and with an inviting look cast upward dissuaded with too much persuading, while hope might seem to overruu desire.
   The other, whose name was written Leucippe, was of a fine daintiness of beauty, her face carrying in it a sober simplicity like one that could do much good and meant no hurt, her eyes having in them such a cheerfulness as nature seemed to smile in them; though her mouth and cheeks obeyed to that pretty demureness which the more one marked the more one would judge the poor soul apt to believe, and therefore the more pity to deceive her.
   Next came the queen of Laconia, one that seemed born in the confines of beauty’s kingdom; for all her lineaments were neither perfect possessioners thereof, nor absolute strangers thereto: but she was a queen and therefore beautiful.
   But she that followed conquered indeed with being conquered, and might well have made all the beholders wait upon her triumph while herself were led captive. It was the excellently fair queen Helen, whose jacinth hair, curled by nature but intercurled by art (like a fine brook through golden sands) had a rope of fair pearl which now hiding, now hidden by the hair, did as it were play at fast and loose each with other, mutually giving and receiving richness. In her face so much beauty and favour expressed as (if Helen had not been known) some would rather have judged it the painter's exercise to show what he could do than the counterfeiting of any living pattern; for no fault the most faultfinding wit could have found, if it were not that to the rest of t e body the face was somewhat too little. But that little was such a spark of beauty as was able to inflame a world of love; for everything was full of a choice fineness, that if it wanted anything in majesty, it supplied it with increase in pleasure; and if at the tret it strake not admiration, it ravished with delight And no indifferent soul there was, which if it could resist from subjecting itself to make it his princess, that would not long to have such a playfellow. As for her attire, it was costly and curious; though the look (fixed with more sadness than it seemed nature had bestowed to any that knew her fortune) betrayed that as she used those ornaments not for herself but to prevail with another, so she feared that all would not serve.
   Of a far differing, though esteemed equal, beauty was the fair Parthenia who next waited on Artesia’s triumph though far better she might have sat in the throne. For in her everything was goodly and stately, yet so, that it might seem that great-mind- edness was but the ensign-bearer to the humbleness. For her great grey eye, which might seem full of her own beauty, a large and exceedingly fair forehead, with all the rest of her face and body cast in the mould of nobleness, was yet so attired as might show the mistress thought it either not to deserve, or not to need any exquisite decking, having no adorning but cleanliness; and so far from all art that it was full of carelessness, unless that carelessness itself, in spite of itself, grew artificial. But Basilius could not abstain from praising Parthenia as the perfect picture of a womanly virtue and wifely faithfulness, telling withal Zelmane how he had understood that when in the court of Laconia her picture, maintained by a certain Syrionian knight, was lost through want rather of valour than justice, her husband, the famous Argalus, would in a chafe have gone and redeemed it with a new trial. But she, more sporting than sorrowing for her undeserved champion, told her husband she desired to be beautiful in nobody’s eye but his, and that she would rather mar her face as evil as ever it was than that it should be a cause to make Argalus put on armour. Then would Basilius have told Zelmane that which she already knew of the rare trial of that coupled affection: but the next picture made their mouths give place to their eyes.
   It was of a young maid which sat pulling out a thorn out of a lamb’s foot, with her look so attentive upon it, as if that little foot could have been the circle of her thoughts; her apparel so poor, as it had nothing but the inside to adorn it; a sheep-hook lying by her with a bottle upon it. But with all that poverty, beauty played the prince and commanded as many hearts as the greatest queen there did. Her beauty and her estate made her quickly to be known to be the fair shepherdess Urania, whom a rich knight called Lacemon, far in love with her, had unluckily defended.
   The last of all in place, because last in the time of her being captive, was Zelmane, daughter to the King Plexirtus, who at the first sight seemed to have some resembling of Philoclea; but with more marking (comparing it to the present Philoclea, who indeed had no paragon but her sister) they might see it was but such a likeness as an unperfect glass doth give, answerable enough in some features and colours, but erring in others. But Zelmane sighing, turning to Basilius, Alas, Sir,’ said she, ‘here be some pictures which might better become the tombs of their mistresses than the triumph of Artesia.'
   ‘It is true, sweetest lady,’ said Basilius, 'some of them be dead, and some other captive; but that hath happened so late as it may be the knights that defended their beauty knew not so much; without we will say (as in some hearts I know it would fall out) that death itself could not blot out the image which love hath engraven in them. But divers besides those,' said Basilius, 'hath Phalantus won, but he leaves the rest, carrying only such who either for greatness of estate or of beauty may justly glorify the glory of Artesia's triumph.'
   
   CHAPTER 17
   Thus talked Basilius with Zelmane, glad to make any matter subject to speak of with his mistress, while Phalantus, in this pompous manner, brought Artesia with her gentlewomen into one tent, by which he had another; where they both waited who Would first strike upon the shield, while Basilius, the judge, appointed sticklers and trumpets to whom the other should obey. But none that day appeared, nor the next, till already it had consumed half his allowance of light; but then there came in a knight, protesting himself as contrary to him in mind as he was m apparel. For Phalantus was all in white, having in his bases and caparison embroidered a waving water, at each side whereof he had nettings cast over, in which were divers fishes naturally made, and so prettily that as the horse stirred, the fishes seemed to strive and leap in the net.
   But the other knight, by name Nestor, by birth an Arcadian, and in affection vowed to the fair shepherdess, was all in black, with fire burning both upon his armour and horse. His impresa in his shield was a fire made of juniper, with this word, ‘More easy and more sweet.’ But this hot knight was cooled with a fall which at the third course he received of Phalantus, leaving this picture to keep company with the other of the same stamp; he going away remedilessly chafing at his rebuke. The next was Polycetes, greatly esteemed in Arcadia for deeds he had done in arms, and much spoken of for the honourable love he had long borne to Gynecia, which Basilius himself was content not only to suffer but to be delighted with, he carried it in so honourable and open plainness, setting to his love no other mark than to do her faithful service. But neither her fair picture nor his fair running could warrant him from overthrow and her from becoming as then the last of Artesia’s victories; a thing Gynecia’s virtues would little have recked at another time, nor then, if Zelmane had not seen it. But her champion went away as much discomforted as discomfited. Then Telamon for Polixena, and Eurileon for Elpine, and Leon for Zoana, all brave knights, all fair ladies, with their going down lifted up the balance of his praise for activity and hers for fairness.
   Upon whose loss, as the beholders were talking, there comes into the place where they ran a shepherd stripling (for his height made him more than a boy, and his face would not allow him a man) brown of complexion, whether by nature or by the sun’s familiarity, but very lovely withal; for the rest so perfectly proportioned that Nature showed she doth not like men who slubber up matters of mean account. And well might his proportion be judged, for he had nothing upon him but a pair of slops, and upon his body a goat skin which he cast over his shoulder, doing all things with so pretty a grace that it seemed ignorance could not make him do amiss because he had a heart to do well. Holding in his right hand a long staff, and so coming with a look full of amiable fierceness, as in whom choler could not take away the sweetness, he came towards the king, and making a reverence, which in him was comely because it was kindly,
   ‘My liege lord,' said he, ‘I pray you hear a few words, for my heart will break if I say not my niind to you. I see here the picture of Urania which, I cannot tell how nor why, these men when they fall down they say is not so fair as yonder gay woman. But pray God I may never see my old mother alive if I think she be any more match to Urania than a goat is to a fine lamb, or than the dog that keeps our flock at home is like your white greyhound that pulled down the stag last day. And therefore I pray you let me be dressed as they be, and my heart gives me I shall tumble him on the earth; for indeed he might as well say that a cowslip is as white as a lily. Or else I care not, let him come with his great staff, and I with this in my hand, and you shall see what I can do to him.’ Basilius saw it was the fine shepherd Lalus, whom once he had afore him in pastoral sports, and had greatly delighted in his wit full of pretty simplicity; and therefore laughing at his earnestness, he bade him be content, since he saw the pictures of so great queens were fain to follow their champions' fortune. But Lalus, even weeping ripe, went among the rest, longing to see somebody that would revenge Urania's wrong, and praying heartily for everybody that ran against Phalantus, then beginning to feel poverty that he could not set himself to that trial.
   But by and by, even when the sun, like a noble heart, began to show his greatest countenance in his lowest estate, there came in a knight called Phebilus, a gentleman of that country, for whom hateful fortune had borrowed the dart of love to make him miserable by the sight of Philoclea. For he had even from her infancy loved her, and was stricken by her before she was able to know what quiver of arrows her eyes carried; but he loved and despaired, and the more he despaired, the more he loved. He saw his own unworthiness, and thereby made her excellency have more terrible aspect upon him. He was so secret therein as not daring to be open, that to no creature he ever spake of it; but his heart made such silent complaints within itself that, while all his senses were attentive thereto, cunning judges might perceive his mind, so that he was known to love though he denied, or rather, was the better known because he denied it. His armour and his attire was of a sea colour; his impresa, the fish called Sepia, which being in the net casts a black ink about itself, that in the darkness thereof it may escape: his word was, ‘Not so.’ Philoclea’s picture with almost an idolatrous magnificence was borne in by him. But straight jealousy was a harbinger for disdain in Zelmane’s heart when she saw any but herself should be avowed a champion for Philoclea; insomuch that she wished his shame till she saw him shamed. For at the second course he was stricken quite from out of the saddle, so full of grief and rage withal that he would fain with the sword have revenged it, but that being contrary to the order set down, Basdius would not suffer; so that wishing himself in the bottom of the earth, he went his way, leaving Zelmane no less angry with his loss than she would have been with his victory. For if she thought before a rival's praise would have angered her, her lady’s disgrace did make her much more forget what she then thought, while that passion reigned so much the more as she saw a pretty blush in Philoclea’s cheeks betray a modest discontentment But the night commanded truce for those sports, and Phalantus, though entreated, would not leave Artesia, who in no case would come into the house, having, as it were, sucked of Cecropia’s breath a mortal mislike against Basilius.
   But the night, measured by the short ell of sleep, was soon passed over, and the next morning had given the watchful stars leave to take their rest, when a trumpet summoned Basilius to play his judge’s part; which he did, taking his wife and daughters with him, Zelmane having locked her door so as they would not trouble her for that time: for already there was a knight in the field ready to prove Helen of Corinth had received great injury, both by the erring judgement of the challenger and the unlucky weakness of her former defender. The new knight was quickly known to be Clitophon (Kalander’s son of Basilius’ sister) by his armour which, all gilt, was so well handled that it showed like a glittering sand and gravel interlaced with silver rivers. His device he had put in the picture of Helen which he defended: it was the Ermion with a speech that signified, ‘Rather dead than spotted.’ But in that armour since he had parted from Helen, who would no longer his company finding him to enter into terms of affection, he had performed so honourable actions, still seeking for his two friends by the names of Palladius and Daiphantus, that though his face were covered, his being was discovered. Which yet Basilius, who had brought him up in his court, would not seem to do, but glad to see trial of him of whom he had heard very well, he commanded the trumpets to sound: to which the two brave knights obeying, they performed their courses, breaking their six staves with so good both skill in the hitting and grace in the manner that it bred some difficulty in the judgement But Basilius in the end gave sentence against Clitophon, because Phalantus had broken more staves upon the head, and that once Clitophon had received such a blow that he had lost the reins of his horse with his head well- nigh touching the crupper of the horse. But Clitophon was so angry with the judgement, wherein he thought he had received wrong, that he omitted his duty to his prince and uncle, and suddenly went his way, still in the quest of them whom as then he had left by seeking, and so yielded the field to the next comer.
   Who, coming in about two hours after, was no less marked than all the rest before, because he had nothing worth the marking. For he had neither picture nor device; his armour of as old a fashion, besides the rusty poorness, that it might better seem a monument °f his grandfather's courage. About his middle he had, instead of bases, a long cloak of silk, which as unhandsomely (as it needs must) became the wearer, so that all that looked on measured his length on the earth already, since he had to meet one who had been victorious of so many gallants. But he went on towards the shield and with a sober grace strake it; but as he let his sword fall Upon it, another knight, all in black, came rustling in who strake the shield almost as soon as he, and so strongly that he brake the shield in two. The ill-appointed knight (for so the beholders called him) angry with that (as he accounted) insolent injury to himself, hit him such a sound blow that they that looked on said it well became a rude arm. The other answered him again in the same case, so that lances were put to silence, the swords were so busy.
   But Phalantus, angry of this defacing his shield, came upon the black knight and with the pommel of his sword set fire to his eyes, which presently was revenged not only by the black but the ill- apparelled knight, who disdained another should enter into his quarrel; so as who ever saw a matachin dance to imitate fighting, this was a fight that did imitate the matachin: for they being but three that fought, everyone had two adversaries, striking him who struck the third, and revenging perhaps that of him which he had received of the other. But Basilius, rising himself, came to part them, the sticklers’ authority scarcely able to persuade choleric hearers; and part them he did.
   But before he could determine, comes in a fourth, halting on foot, who complained to Basilius, demanding justice on the black knight for having by force taken away the picture of Pamela from him, which in little form he ware in a tablet, and covered with silk had fastened it to his helmet, purposing, for want of a bigger, to paragon the little one with Artesia’s length, not doubting but even in that little quantity the excellency of that would shine through the weakness of the other as the smallest star doth through the whole element of fire. And by the way he had met with this black knight who had, as he said, robbed him of it. The injury seemed grievous, but when it came fully to be examined, it was found that the halting knight meeting the other, asking the cause of his going thitherward and finding it was to defend Pamela’s divine beauty against Artesia’s, with a proud jollity commanded him to leave that quarrel only for him who was only worthy to enter into it But the black knight obeying no such commandments, they fell to such a bickering that he gat a halting and lost his picture. This understood by Basilius, he told him he was now fitter to look to his own body than another’s picture, and so, uncomforted therein, sent him away to learn of Aesculapius that he was not fit for Venus.
   
   But then the question arising, who should be the former against Phalantus of the black or the ill-apparelled knight (who now had gotten the reputation of some sturdy lout, he had so well defended himself); of the one side, was alleged the having a picture which the other wanted; of the other side, the first striking the shield: but the conclusion was that the ill-apparelled knight should have the precedence, if he delivered the figure of his mistress to Phalantus; who asking him for it:
   ‘Certainly,’ said he, ‘her liveliest picture, if you could see it, is in my heart, and the best comparison I could make of her is of the sun and all the other heavenly beauties. But because perhaps all eyes cannot taste the divinity of her beauty, and would rather be dazzled than taught by the light, if it be not clouded by some meaner thing, know you then that I defend that same lady whose image Phebilus so feebly lost yesternight, and, instead of another, if you overcome me, you shall have me your slave to carry that image in your mistress’ triumph.’ Phalantus easily agreed to the bargain, which already he made his own.
   But when it came to the trial, the ill-apparelled knight, choosing out the greatest staves in all the store, at the first course gave his head such a remembrance that he lost almost his remembrance, he himself receiving the encounter of Phalantus without any extraordinary motion; and at the second, gave him such a counterbluff, that because Phalantus was so perfect a horseman as not to be driven from the saddle, the saddle with broken girths was driven from the horse; Phalantus remaining angry and amazed, because now being come almost to the last of his promised enterprise, that disgrace befell him which he had never before known.
   But the victory being by the judges given, and the trumpets Witnessed to the ill-apparelled knight, Phalantus disgrace was ingrieved in lieu of comfort of Artesia, who telling him she never looked for other, bade him seek some other mistress. He excusing himself, and turning over the fault to Fortune, Then let that be your ill fortune too,’ said she, ‘that you have lost me.’
   ‘Nay, truly madam,’ said Phalantus, ‘it shall not be so, for  think the loss of such a mistress will prove a great gam,’ and so concluded, to the sport of Basilius to see young folks’ love, that came in masked with so great pomp, go out with so little constancy. But Phalantus, first professing great service to Basilius for his courteous intermitting his solitary course for his sake, would yet conduct Artesia to the castle of Cecropia whither she desired to go, vowing in himself that neither heart nor mouth-love should ever any more entangle him. And with that resolution he left the company.
   Whence all being dismissed (among whom the black knight went away repining at his luck that had kept him from winning the honour, as he knew he should have done, to the picture of Pamela) the ill-apparelled knight (who was only desired to stay because Basilius meant to show him to Zelmane) pulled off his helmet and then was known himself to be Zelmane, who that morning, as she told, while the others were busy, had stolen out to the prince's stable, which was a mile off from the lodge, had gotten a horse - they knowing it was Basilius’ pleasure she should be obeyed - and borrowing that homely armour for want of a better, had come upon the spur to redeem Philoclea’s picture which, she said, she could not bear (being one of that little wildemess- company) should be in captivity, if the cunning she had learned in her country of the noble Amazons could withstand it And under that pretext fain she would have given a secret passport to her affection. But this act painted at one instant redness in Philoclea's face and paleness in Gynecia’s, but brought forth no other countenances but of admiration, no speeches but of commendations; all these few, besides love, thinking they honoured themselves in honouring so accomplished a person as Zelmane, whom daily they sought with some or other sports to delight; for which purpose Basilius had, in a house not far off, servants who, though they came not uncalled, yet at call were ready.
   CHAPTER 18
   And so many days were spent and many ways used, while Zelmane was like one that stood in a tree waiting a good occasion to shoot, and Gynecia a blancher which kept the dearest deer from her. But the day being come on which, according to an appointed course, the shepherds were to assemble and make their pastoral sports afore Basilius, Zelmane, (fearing lest many eyes, and coming divers ways, might hap to spy Musidorus) went out to warn him thereof.
   But before she could come to the arbour, she saw walking from ner-ward a man in shepherdish apparel, who being in the sight of the lodge, it might seem he was allowed there. A long cloak he had on, but that cast under his right arm, wherein he held a sheep hook so finely wrought that it gave a bravery to poverty; and his raiments, though they were mean, yet received they handsomeness by the grace of the wearer, though he himself went but a kind of languishing pace, with his eyes sometimes cast up to heaven (as though his fancies strove to mount higher) sometimes thrown down to the ground (as if the earth could not bear the burden of his sorrows). At length, with a lamentable tune, he sung these few verses.
   
Come shepherd’s weeds, become your master’s mind:
	Yield outward show what inward change he tries:
Nor be abash'd, since such a guest you find,
	Whose strongest hope in your weak comfort lies.

Come shepherd's weeds, attend my woeful cries:
	Disuse yourselves from sweet Menalcas’ voice: 
For other be those tunes which sorrow ties 
	From those clear notes which freely may rejoice.
		Then pour out plaint, and in one word say this:
		Helpless his plaint who spoils himself of bliss.
   And having ended, he struck himself on the breast, saying, O miserable wretch, whither do thy destinies guide thee?
   The voice made Zelmane hasten her pace to overtake him, which having done, she plainly perceived that it was her dear friend Musidorus; whereat marvelling not a little, she demanded of him whether the goddess of those woods had such a power to transform every body, or whether, as in all enterprises else he had done, he meant thus to match her in this new alteration.
   ‘Alas,’ said Musidorus,‘what shall I say, who am loth to say, and yet fain would have said? I find, indeed, that all is but lip-wisdom which wants experience. I now (woe is me) do try what love can do. O Zelmane, who will resist it must either have no wit, or put out his eyes. Can any man resist his creation? Certainly by love we are made, and to love we are made. Beasts only cannot discern beauty, and let them be in the roll of beasts that do not honour it’ The perfect friendship Zelmane bare him, and the great pity she, by good trial, had of such cases, could not keep her from smiling at him, remembering how vehemently he had cried out against the folly of lovers; and therefore a little to punish him, 'Why, how now dear cousin,' said she, 'you that were last day so high in the pulpit against lovers, are you now become so mean an auditor? Remember that love is a passion, and that a worthy man’s reason must ever have the masterhood.'
   ‘I recant, I recant,’ cried Musidorus, and withal falling down prostrate, ‘O thou celestial, or infernal spirit of love, or what other heavenly or hellish title thou list to have (for effects of both I find in myself) have compassion of me, and let thy glory be as great in pardoning them that be submitted to thee as in conquering those that were rebellious.’
   ‘No, no,’ said Zelmane, ‘I see you well enough you make but an interlude of my mishaps, and do but counterfeit thus to make me see the deformity of my passions. But take heed that this jest do not one day turn to earnest.’
   ‘Now I beseech thee,’ said Musidorus, taking her fast by the hand, ‘even for the truth of our friendship (of which, if I be not altogether an unhappy man, thou hast some remembrance) and by those secret flames which I know have likewise nearly touched thee, make no jest of that which hath so earnestly pierced me through, nor let that be light to thee which is to me so burdenous that I am not able to bear it.’
   Musidorus, both in words and behaviour, did so lively deliver out his inward grief that Zelmane found indeed he was thoroughly wounded: but there rose a new jealousy in her mind, lest it might be with Philoclea, by whom, as Zelmane thought, in right all hearts and eyes should be inherited. And therefore desirous tobecleared of that doubt, Musidorusshortly, as in haste and lull of passionate perplexedness, thus recounted his case unto her.
   The day,’ said he, ‘I parted from you, I being in mind to return to a town from whence I came hither, my horse (being before tired) would scarce bear me a mile hence; where being benighted, the light of a candle I saw a good way off guided me to a young shepherd s house, by name Menalcas, who, seeing me to be a straying stranger, with the right honest hospitality which seems to be harboured in the Arcadian breasts, and, though not with curious costliness, yet with cleanly sufficiency, entertained me. And having by talk with him found the manner of the country something more in particular than I had by Kalander’s report, I agreed to sojourn with him in secret, which he faithfully promised to observe. And so hither to your arbour divers times repaired; and here by your means had the sight - O that it had never been sol Nay, O that it might ever be sol - of the goddess who in a definite compass can set forth infinite beauty.’
   All this while Zelmane was racked with jealousy. But he went on, 'For,' said he, ‘I lying close, and in truth thinking of you, and saying thus to myself, “O sweet Pyrocles, how art thou bewitched! Where is thy virtue? Where is the use of thy reason? How much am I inferior to thee in the state of mind, and yet know I that all the heavens cannot bring me to such a thraldom!” Scarcely, think had I spoken this word when the ladies came forth; at which sight, I think the very words returned back again to strike my soul: at least, an unmeasurable sting I felt in myself that I had spoken such words.'
   ‘At which sight?' said Zelmane, not able to bear him any longer.
   ‘O,’ said Musidorus, ‘I know your suspicion. No, no, banish all such fear; it was, it is, and must be Pamela.’
   'Then all is safe,’ said Zelmane. ‘Proceed, dear Musidorus.
   ‘I will not,’ said he, ‘impute it to my late solitary life, which yet is prone to affections, nor to the much thinking of you (though that called the consideration of love into my mind, which before I ever neglected) nor to the exaltation of Venus, nor revenge of Cupid; but even to her who is the planet, nay, the goddess, against which the only shield must be my sepulchre. When I first saw her, I was presently stricken, and I (like a foolish child that, when anything hits him, will strike himself again upon it) would needs look again, as though  would persuade mine eyes that they were deceived. But alas, well have I found that love to a yielding heart is a king, but to a resisting, is a tyrant. The more with arguments I shaked the stake which he had planted in the ground of my heart, the deeper still it sank into it. But what mean I to speak of the causes of my love, which is as impossible to describe as to measure the back-side of heaven? Let this word suffice: I love. And that you may know I do so, it was I that came in black armour to defend her picture, where I was both prevented and beaten by you. And so I that waited here to do you service have now myself most need of succour.'
   ‘But whereupon got you yourself this apparel?' said Zelmane.
   ‘I had forgotten to tell you,' said Musidorus, ‘though that were one principal matter of my speech; so much am I now master of my own mind. But thus it happened. Being returned to Menalcas' house full of tormenting desire, after a while fainting under the weight, my courage stirred up my wit to seek for some relief before I yielded to perish. At last this came into my head, that very evening that I had to no purpose last used my horse and armour.
   I told Menalcas that I was a Thessalian gentleman who, by mischance having killed a great favourite of the prince of that country, was pursued so cruelly that in no place but either by favour or corruption they would obtain my destruction; and that therefore I was determined, till the fury of my persecutors might be assuaged, to disguise myself among the shepherds of Arcadia and, if it were possible, to be one of them that were allowed the prince's presence; because if the worst should fall that I were discovered, yet having gotten the acquaintance of the prince, it might happen to move his heart to protect me. Menalcas, being of an honest disposition, pitied my case, which my face through my inward torment made credible; and so (I giving him largely for it) let me have this raiment, instructing me in all the particularities touching himself or myself which I desired to know. Yet not trusting so much to his constancy as that I would lay my life, and life of my life upon it, I hired him to go into Thessalia to a friend of mine, end to deliver him a letter from me; conjuring him to bring me as speedy an answer as he could, because it imported me greatly to know whether certain of my friends did yet possess any favour, whose intercessions I might use for my restitution.
   He willingly took my letter, which being well sealed, indeed contained other matter. For I wrote to my trusty servant Kalodulus, whom you know, that as soon as he had delivered the letter, he should keep him prisoner in his house, not suffering him to have conference with any body till he knew my further pleasure; in all other respects that he should use him as my brother. And thus is Menalcas gone, and I here a poor shepherd; more proud of this estate than of any kingdom, so manifest it is that the highest point outward things can bring one unto is the contentment of the mind with which no estate, without which, all estates be miserable. Now have I chosen this day because, as Menalcas told me, the other shepherds are called to make their sports, and hope that you will with your credit find means to get me allowed among them.
   You need not doubt/ answered Zelmane, ‘but that I will be your good mistress. Marry, the best way of dealing must be by Dametas, who - since his blunt brain hath perceived some favour the prince doth bear unto me (as without doubt the most servile flattery is lodged most easily in the grossest capacity, for their ordinary conceit draweth a yielding to their greaters, and then have they not wit to discern the right degrees of duty) - is muc more serviceable unto me than I can find any cause to wish im. And therefore despair not to win him, for every present occasion will catch his senses, and his senses are masters of his silly min Only reverence him, and reward him, and with that bridle and saddle you shall well ride him.’
   ‘O heaven and earth.' said Musidorus, ‘to what a pass are our minds brought that from the right line of virtue are wried to these crooked shifts! But O love, it is thou that does it; thou changest name upon name; thou disguisest our bodies, and disfigurest our minds. But indeed thou hast reason, for though the ways be foul, the journey's end is most fair and honourable.'
   
   CHAPTER 19 
   No more, sweet Musidorus,’ said Zelmane, ‘of these philosophies, for here comes the very person of Dametas.’ And so he did indeed, with a sword by his side, a forest-bill on his neck, and a chopping- knife under his girdle, in which well provided sort he had ever gone since the fear Zelmane had put him in. But he no sooner saw her, but with head and arms he laid his reverence afore her enough to have made any man forswear all courtesy. And then in Basilius’ name he did invite her to walk down to the place where that day they were to have the pastorals.
   But when he spied Musidorus to be none of the shepherds allowed in that place, he would fain have persuaded himself to utter some anger but that he durst not. Yet muttering and champing, as though his cud troubled him, he gave occasion to Musidorus to come near him and feign this tale of his own life: that he was a younger brother of the shepherd Menalcas, by name Dorus, sent by his father in his tender age to Athens, there to learn some cunning more than ordinary that he might be the better liked of the prince; and that after his father’s death, his brother Menalcas (lately gone thither to fetch him home) was also deceased, where, upon his death, he had charged him to seek the service of Dametas, and to be wholly and ever guided by him as one in whose judgement andintegrity theprince had singular confidence. For token whereof he gave to Dametas a good sum of gold in ready coin, which Menalcas had bequeathed unto him upon condition he should receive this poor Dorus into his service that his mind and manners might grow the better by his daily example.
   Dametas, that of all manner of style could best conceive of golden eloquence, being withal tickled by Musidorus’ praises, had hie brain so turned that he became slave to that which he that sued to be his servant offered to give him; yet for countenance sake, he seemed very squeamish in respect of the charge he had of the princess Pamela. But such was the secret operation of the gold, helped with the persuasion of the Amazon, Zelmane (who said it was pity so handsome a young man should be anywhere else than with so good a master) that in the end he agreed, if that day he behaved himself so to the liking of Basilius as he might be contented, that thc-n he would receive him into his service.
   And thus went they to the lodge, where they found Gynecia and her daughters ready to go to the field, to delight themselves there a while until the shepherds’ coming: whither also taking Zelmane with them, as they went Dametas told them of Dorus, and desired he might be accepted there that day instead of his brother Menalcas. As for Basilius, he stayed behind to bring the shepherds, with whom he meant to confer, to breed the better Zelmane’s likir.g (which he only regarded) while the other beautiful band came to the fair field appointed for the shepherdish pastimes. It was indeed a place of delight; for through the midst of it there ran a sweet brook which did both hold the eye open with her azure streams, and yet seek to close the eye with the purling noise it made upon the pebble stones it ran over: the field itself being set in some places with roses, and in all the rest constantly preserving a flourishing green. The roses added such a ruddy show unto it, as though the field were bashful at his own beauty. About it, as if it had been to enclose a theatre, grew such sort of trees as either excellency of fruit, stateliness of growth, continual greenness, or poetical fancies, have made at any time famous. In most part of which there had been framed by art such pleasant arbours, that, one answering another, they became a gallery aloft from tree to tree almost round about, which below gave a perfect shadow, a pleasant refuge then from the choleric look of Phoebus.
   In this place while Gynecia walked hard by them, carrying many unquiet contentions about her, the ladies sat them down, inquiring diverse questions of the shepherd Dorus; who, keeping his eye still upon Pamela, answered with such a trembling voice and abashed countenance and oftentimes so far from the matter, that it was some sport to the young ladies, thinking it waneducation which made him so discountenanced with unwonted presence. But Zelmane that saw in him the glass of her own misery, taking the hand of Philoclea, and with burning kisses setting it close to her lips (as if it should stand there like a hand in the margin of a book to note some saying worthy to be marked) began to speak these words: ‘O love, since thou art so changeable in men’s estates, how art thou so constant in their torments?' — when suddenly there came out of a wood a monstrous lion, with a she-bear not far from him of a little less fierceness, which, as they guessed, having been hunted in forests far off, were by chance come thither where before such beasts had never been seen. Then care not fear, or fear not for themselves altered something the countenances of the two lovers, but so as any man might perceive was rather an assembling of powers than dismayedness of courage.
   Philoclea no sooner espied the lion but that, obeying the commandment of fear, she leaped up and ran to the lodge-ward as fast as her delicate legs could carry her, while Dorus drew Pamela behind a tree, where she stood quaking like the partridge on which the hawk is even ready to seize. But the lion, seeing Philoclea run away, bent his race to her-ward, and was ready to seize' himself on the prey when Zelmane (to whom danger then was a cause of dreadlessness, all the composition of her elements being nothing but fiery) with swiftness of desire crossed him, and with force of affection strake him such a blow upon his chine that she opened all his body: wherewith the valiant beast turning upon her with open jaws, she gave him such a thrust through his breast that all the lion could do was with his paw to tear off the mantle and sleeve of Zelmane with a little scratch rather than a wound, his death-blow having taken away the effect of his force.
   But therewithal, he fell down, and gave Zelmane leisure to take off his head to carry it for a present to her lady Philoclea: who all this while, not knowing what was done behind her, kept on her course like Arethusa when she ran from Alpheus; her light apparel being carried up with the wind, that much of those beauties she would at another time have willingly hidden was presented to the sight of the twice wounded Zelmane. Which made Zelmane not follow her over-hastily, lest she should too soon deprive herself of that pleasure; but carrying the lion's head in her hand, did not fully overtake her till they came to the presence of Basilius. Neither were they long there but that Gynecia came thither also, who had been in such a trance of musing, that Zelmane was fighting with the lion before she knew of any lion’s coming.
   But then affection resisting, and the soon ending of the fight preventing all extremity of fear, she marked Zelmane’s fighting: and when the lion’s head was off, as Zelmane ran after Philoclea, so she could not find in her heart but run after Zelmane: so that it was a new sight Fortune had prepared to those woods, to see those great personages thus run one after the other, each carried forward with an inward violence; Philoclea with such fear that she thought she was still in the lion's mouth; Zelmane with an eager and impatient delight; Gynecia with wings of love, flying she neither knew nor cared to know whither. But now, being all come before Basilius amazed with this sight, and fear having such possession in the fair Philoclea that her blood durst not yet to come to her face to take away the name of paleness from her most pure whiteness, Zelmane kneeled down, and presenting the lion’s head unto her:
   ‘Only lady,’ said she, ‘here see you the punishment of that unnatural beast which, contrary to his own kind, would have wronged prince's blood, guided with such traitorous eyes as durst rebel against your beauty/
   ‘Happy am I, and my beauty both,’ answered the sweet Philoclea then blushing (for fear had bequeathed his room to his kinsman bashfulness) ‘that you, excellent Amazon, were there to teach him good manners.’
   ‘And even thanks to that beauty,’ answered Zelmane, ‘which can give an edge to the bluntest swords.’
   There Philoclea told her father how it had happened; but as she had turned her eyes in her tale to Zelmane she perceived some blood upon Zelmane’s shoulder, so that starting with the lovely grace of pity, she showed it to her father and mother, who (as the nurse sometimes with over-much kissing may forget to give the babe suck) so had they with too much delighting, in beholding and praising Zelmane, left off to mark whether she needed succour. But then they ran both unto her, like a father and mother to an only child, and (though Zelmane assured them it was nothing) would needs see it, Gynecia having skill in surgery, an art in those days much esteemed because it served to virtuous courage which even ladies would, ever with the contempt of cowards, seem to cherish. But looking upon it - which gave more inward bleeding wounds to Zelmane, for she might sometimes feel Philoclea’s touch whiles she helped her mother - she found it was indeed of no importance; yet applied she a precious balm unto it of power to heal a greater grief.
   But even then, and not before, they remembered Pamela; and therefore Zelmane, thinking of her friend Dorus, was running back to be satisfied, when they might all see Pamela coming between Dorus and Dametas, having in her hand the paw of a bear which the shepherd Dorus had newly presented unto her, desiring her to accept it as of such a beast which though she deserved death for her presumption, yet was her wit to be esteemed since she could make so sweet a choice. Dametas for his part came piping and dancing, the merriest man in a parish: but when he came so near as he might be heard of Basilius, he would needs break through his ears with this joyful song of their good success.
   
Now thanked be the great god Pan,
	Which thus preserves my loved life:
Thanked be I that keep a man,
	Who ended hath this bloody strife:
For if my Man must praises have,
	What then must I, that keep the knave?
For as the Moon the eye doth please,
	With gentle beams not hurting sight:
Yet hath Sir Sun the greatest praise,
	Because from him doth come her light:
So if my man must praises have,
	What then must I, that keep the knave?
   Being all now come together, and all desirous to know each other’s adventures, Pamela’s noble heart would needs gratefully make known the valiant means of her safety, which, directing her speech to her mother, she did in this manner:
   ‘As soon,' said she, ‘as ye were all run away and that I hoped to be in safety, there came out of the same woods a foul horrible bear, which (fearing belike to deal while the lion was present) as soon as he was gone came furiously towards the place where I was, and this young shepherd left alone by me. I truly (not guilty of any wisdom, which since they lay to my charge, because they say it is the best refuge against that beast, but even pure fear bringing forth that effect of wisdom) fell down flat on my face, needing not counterfeit being dead, for indeed I was little better. But this young shepherd with a wonderful courage, having no other weapon but that knife you see, standing before the place where I lay, so behaved himself Jiat the first sight I had, when I thought myself already near Charon's ferry, was the shepherd showing me his bloody knife in token of victory.'
   ‘I pray you,’ said Zelmane, speaking to Dorus whose valour she was careful to have manifested, ‘in what sort, so ill weaponed, could you achieve this enterprise?'
   ‘Noble lady,’ said Dorus, ‘the manner of these beasts fighting with any man is to stand up upon their hinder feet; and so this did, and being ready to give me a shrewd embracement, I think the god Pan, ever careful of the chief blessing of Arcadia, guided my hand so just to the heart of the beast that neither she could once touch me nor (which is the only matter in this worthy remembrance) breed any danger to the princess. For my part, I am rather with all subjected humbleness to thank her excellencies, since the duty thereunto gave me heart to save myself, than to receive thanks for a deed which was her only inspiring.'
   And this Dorus spake, keeping affection as much as he could back from coming into his eyes and gestures. But Zelmane, that had the same character in her heart, could easily decipher it, and therefore to keep him the longer in speech, desired to understand the conclusion of- the matter, and how the honest Dametas was escaped.
   ‘Nay/ said Pamela, ‘none shall take that office from myself, being so much bound to him as I am for my education.' And with that word, scorn borrowing the countenance of mirth, somewhat she smiled, and thus spake on: ‘When/ said she, ‘Dorus made me assuredly perceive that all cause of fear was passed, the truth is I was ashamed to find myself alone with this shepherd: and therefore looking about me if I could see anybody, at length we both perceived the gentle Dametas, lying with his head and breast as far as he could thrust himself into a bush, drawing up his legs as close unto him as he could; for like a man of a very kind nature, soon to take pity of himself he was full resolved not to see his own death. And when this shepherd pushed him, bidding him to be of good cheer, it was a great while ere we could persuade him that Dorus was not the bear, so that he was fain to pull him out by the heels and show him the beast as dead as he could wish it, which, you may believe me, was a very joyful sight unto him. But then he forgat all courtesy, for he fell upon the beast, giving it many a manful wound, swearing by much it was not well such beasts should be suffered in a commonwealth. And then my governor, a full of joy as before of fear, came dancing and singing before, as even now you saw him.'
   'Well, well,’ said Basilius, I have not chosen Dametas for his fighting, nor for his discoursing but for his plainness and honesty, and therein I know he will not deceive me.'
   But then he told Pamela - not so much because she should know it as because he would tell it - the wonderful act Zelmane had performed, which Gynecia likewise spake of, both in such extremity of praising as was easy to be seen the construction of their speech might best be made by the grammar rules of affection. Basilius told with what a gallant grace she ran with the lion’s head in her hand, like another Pallas with the spoils of Gorgon. Gynecia sware she saw the very face of the young Hercules killing the Nemean lion; and all with a grateful assent confirmed the same praises. Only poor Dorus, though of equal desert yet not proceeding of equal estate, should have been forgotten, had not Zelmane again with great admiration begun to speak of him, asking whether it were the fashion or no in Arcadia that shepherds should perform such valorous enterprises.
   This Basilius, having the quick sense of a lover, took as though his mistress had given him a secret reprehension that he had not showed more gratefulness to Dorus; and therefore, as nimbly as he could, inquired of his estate, adding promise of great rewards; among the rest, offering to him (if he would exercise his courage in soldiery) he would commit some charge unto him under his lieutenant Philanax. But Dorus (whose ambition climbed by another stair) having first answered touching his estate that he was brother to the shepherd Menalcas, who among others was wont to resort to the prince’s presence, and excused his going to soldiery by the unaptness he found in himself that way; he told Basilius that his brother in his last testament had willed him to serve Dametas, and therefore, for due obedience thereunto, he would think his service greatly rewarded if he might obtain by that means to live in the sight of the prince and yet practise his own chosen vocation. Basilius, liking well his goodly shape and handsome manner, charged Dametas to receive him like a son into his house, saying, that his valour and Dametas’ truth would be good bulwarks against such mischiefs, as, he sticked not to say, were threatened to his daughter Pamela.
   Dametas, no whit out of countenance with all that had been said (because he had no worse to fall into than his own) accepted Dorus; and withal telling Basilius that some of the shepherds were come, demanded in what place he would see their sports. Who first curious to know whether it were not more requisite for Zelmane’s hurt to rest than sit up at those pastimes, and she (that felt no wound but one) earnestly desiring to have the Pastorals, Basilius commanded it should be at the gate of the lodge: where the throne of the prince being, according to the ancient manner, he made Zelmane sit between him and his wife therein (who thought herself between drowning and burning) and the two young ladies of either side the throne; and so prepared their eyes and ears to be delighted by the shepherds.
   But before all of them were assembled to begin their sports, there came a fellow who, being out of breath, or seeming so to be for haste, with humble hastiness told Basilius that his mistress, the lady Cecropia, had sent him to excuse the mischance of her beasts ranging in that dangerous sort, being happened by the folly of the keeper, who, thinking himself able to rule them, had carried them abroad and so was deceived: whom yet, if Basilius would punish for it, she was ready to deliver. Basilius made no other answer but that his mistress, if she had any more such beasts, should cause them to be killed: and then he told his wife and Zelmane of it, because they should not fear those woods as though they harboured such beasts where the like had never been seen. But Gynecia took a further conceit of it, mistrusting greatly Cecropia, because she had heard much of the devilish wickedness of her heart, and that particularly she did her best to bring up her son Amphialus (being brother’s son to Basilius) to aspire to the crown as next heir male after Basilius; and therefore saw no reason but that she might conjecture it proceeded rather of some mischievous practice than of misfortune. Yet did she only utter her doubt to her daughters, thinking, since the worst was past, she would attend a further occasion, lest overmuch haste might seem to proceed of the ordinary mislike between sisters-in-law. Only they marvelled that BasiJius looked no further into it, who, good man, thought so much of his late conceived commonwealth, that all other matters were but digressions unto him. But the shepherds were ready, and with well handling themselves, called their senses to attend their pastimes.
   THE FIRST ECLOGUES
   Basilius, because Zelmane so would have it, used the artificial day of torches to lighten the sports their inventions could minister; and because many of the shepherds were but newly come, he did in a gentle manner chastise their negligence with making them, for that night, the torch bearers; and the others he willed with all freedom of speech and behaviour to keep their accustomed method. Which while they prepared to do, Dametas, who much disdained (since his late authority) all his old companions, brought his servant Dorus in good acquaintance and allowance of them, and himself stood like a director over them, with nodding, gaping, winking, or stamping, showing how he did like or mislike those things he did not understand. The first sports the shepherds showed were full of such leaps and gambols as, being accorded to the pipe (which they bore in their mouths even as they danced) made a right picture of their chief god Pan and his companions the Satyrs. Then would they cast away their pipes, and holding hand in hand, dance as it were in a brawl by the only cadence of their voices, which they would use in singing some short couplets, whereto the one half beginning, the other half should answer. As the one half, saying:
   
	We love, and have our loves rewarded,
The others would answer,
	We love, and axe no whit regarded.
The first again,
	We find most sweet affection’s snare.
With like tune it should be as in a choir sent back again,
	That sweet, but sour, despairful care.
A third time likewise thus:
	Who can despair, whom hope doth bear?
The answer,
	And who can hope that feels despair?

Then all joining their voices and dancing a faster measure, they would conclude with some such words:

	As without breath no pipe doth move,
		No music kindly without love.
   Having thus varied both their songs and dances into divers sorts of inventions, their last sport was one of them to provoke another to a more large expressing of his passions: which Thyrsis (accounted one of the best singers amongst them) having marked in Dorus’ dancing no less good grace and handsome behaviour than extreme tokens of a troubled mind, began first with his pipe and then with his voice thus to challenge Dorus, and was by him answered in the under-written sort.
   
THYRSIS • DORUS

THYRSIS: Come Dorus, come, let songs thy sorrows signify;
	And if for want of use thy mind ashamed is,
That very shame with love’s high title dignify.
	No style is held for base where love well named is:
Each ear sucks up the words a true-love scattereth,
And plain speech oft than quaint phrase better framed is.

DORUS: Nightingales seldom sing, the pye still chattereth, 
	The wood cries most, before it throughly kindled be, 
Deadly wounds inward bleed, each slight sore mattereth.
	Hardly they herd, which by good hunters singled be: 
Shallow brooks murmur most, deep, silent slide away,
Nor true-love loves his loves with others mingled be.
   
THYRSIS: If thou wilt not be seen, thy face go hide away,
Be none of us, or else maintain our fashion:
Who frowns at others’ feasts doth better bide away.
But if thou hast a love, in that love’s passion,
I challenge thee by show of her perfection,
Which of us two deserveth most compassion.

DORUS: Thy challenge great, but greater my protection:
Sing theii, and see (for now thou hast inflamed me)
Thy health too mean a match for my infection.
No, though the heavens for high attempts have blamed me, 
Yet high is my attempt. O Muse historify 
Her praise, whose praise to learn your skill hath framed me.

THYRSIS: Muse hold your peace; but thou, my god Pan, glorify 
My Kala’s gifts, who with all good gifts filled is.
Thy pipe, O Pan, shall help, though I sing sorrily.
A heap of sweets she is, where nothing spilled is;
Who though she be no Bee, yet full of honey is:
A Lily-field, with plough of Rose which tilled is:
Mild as a lamb, more dainty than a coney is:
Her eyes my eye-sight is, her conversation 
More glad to me than to a miser money is.
What coy account she makes of estimation:
How nice to touch! How all her speeches peized be!
A nymph thus turned, but mended in translation.

DORUS: Such Kala is: but ah my fancies raised be
In one, whose name to name were high presumption,
Since virtues all, to make her title, pleased be.
O happy gods, which by inward assumption
Enjoy her soul, in body’s fair possession,
And keep it joined, fearing your seat’s consumption.
How oft with rain of tears skies make confession 
Their dwellers rapt with sight of her perfection 
From heav’nly throne to her heav’n use digression? 
Of best things then what world can yield confection
To liken her? Deck yours with your comparison:
She is herself of best things the collection.

Thyrsis: How oft my doleful sire cry’d to me, ‘Tarry son,’
When first he spied my love! How oft he said to me,
‘Thou art no soldier fit for Cupid's garrison.
My son, keep this, that my long toil hath laid to me:
Love well thine own: methinks wool’s whiteness passeth all:
I never found long love such wealth hath paid to me,’
This wind he spent: but when my Kala glasseth all 
My sight in her fair limbs, I then assure myself,
Not rotten sheep, but high crowns she surpasseth all.
Can I be poor, that her gold hair procure myself?
Want I white wool, whose eyes her white skin garnished?
Till I get her, shall I to keep enure myself?

Dorus: How oft, when reason saw love of her hamished
With armour of my heart, he cried, ‘O vanity,
To set a pearl in steel so meanly varnished!
Look to thyself; reach not beyond humanity.
Her mind, beams, state, far from thy weak wings banished;
And love which lover hurts is inhumanity.’
Thus reason said: but she came, reason vanished;
Her eyes so mastering me, that such objection
Seemed but to spoil the food of thoughts long famished.
Her peerless height my mind to high erection 
Draws up; and if hope-failing end life’s pleasure,
Of fairer death how can I make election?

THYRSIS: Once my well-waiting eyes espied my treasure,
With sleeves turn’d up, loose hair, and breast enlarged, 
Her father’s corn (moving her fair limbs) measure.
‘O,’ cried I, 'of so mean work be discharged:
Measure my case, how by thy beauty’s filling,
With seed of woes my heart brim-full is charged.
Thy father bids thee save, and chides for spilling;
Save then my soul, spill not my thoughts well heaped;
No lovely praise was ever got by killing.’
These bold words she did hear, this fruit I reaped,
That she, whose look alone might make me blessed,
Did smile on me, and then away she leaped.

Dorus: Once, O sweet once, I saw with dread oppressed 
Her whom I dread, so that with prostrate lying 
Her length the earth in love’s chief clothing dressed.
I saw that riches fall, and fell a crying:
‘Let not dead earth enjoy so dear a cover,
But deck therewith my soul for your sake dying.
Lay all your fear upon your fearful lover:
Shine eyes on me, that both our lives be guarded;
So I your sight, you shall yourselves recover.’
I cried, and was with open rays rewarded:
But straight they fled, summoned by cruel honour, 
Honour, the cause desert is not regarded.

Thyrsis: This maid, thus made for joys, O Pan, bemoan her, 
That without love she spends her years of love:
So fair a field would well become an owner.
And if enchantment can a hard heart move,
Teach me what circle may acquaint her sprite 
Affection’s charms in my behalf to prove.
The circle is my round-about-her sight;
The power I will invoke dwells in her eyes;
My charm should be, she haunt me day and night.

Dorus: Far other care, O Muse, my sorrow tries,
Bent to such one in whom, myself must say,
Nothing can mend one point that in her lies.
What circle then in so rare force bears sway?
Whose sprite all sprites can foil, raise, damn, or save,
No charm holds her, but well possess she may;
Possess she doth, and makes my soul her slave:
My eyes the bands, my thoughts the fatal knot.
No thrall like them that inward bondage have.

Thyrsis: Kala, at length, conclude my lingering lot:
Disdain me not, although I be not fair.
Who is an heir of many hundred sheep 
Doth beauties keep which never sun can burn,
Nor storms do turn: fairness serves oft to wealth.
Yet all my health I place in yorr good will;
Which if you will (O do) bestow on me,
Such as you see, such still you shall me find,
Constant and kind: my sheep your food shall breed,
Their wool your weed; I will you music yield 
In flowery field; and as the day begins,
With twenty gins we will the small birds take,
And pastimes make, as Nature things hath made.
But when in shade we meet of myrtle boughs,
Then love allows, our pleasures to enrich,
The thought of which doth pass all worldly pelf.

DORUS: Lady yourself, whom neither name I dare,
And titles are but spots to such a worth,
Hear plaints come forth from dungeon of my mind.
The noblest kind rejects not others’ woes.
I have no shows of wealth: my wealth is you,
My beauty’s hue your beams, my health your deeds;
My mind for weeds your virtue’s livery wears.
My food is tears; my tunes waymenting yield;
Despair my field; the flowers, spirit’s wars:
My day new cares; my gins my daily sight, 
In which do light small birds of thoughts o’erthrown:
My pastimes none: time passeth on my fall:
Nature made all, but me of dolours made.
I find no shade, but where my sun doth burn:
No place to turn; without, within it fries:
Nor help by life or death, who living dies.

Thyrsis: But if my Kala thus my suit denies,
Which so much reason bears,
Let crows pick out mine eyes, which too much saw.
If she still hate love's law,
My earthy mould doth melt in watery tears.

DORUS: My earthy mould doth melt in watery tears,
And they again resolve 
To air of sighs, sighs to the heart’s fire turn,
Which doth to ashes bum.
Thus doth my life within itself dissolve.

Thyrsis: Thus doth my life within itself dissolve 
That I grow like the beast,
Which bears the bit a weaker force doth guide,
Yet patient must abide.
Such weight it hath, which once is full possessed.

DORUS: Such weight it hath, which once is full possessed, 
That I become a vision,
Which hath in others’ head his only being,
And lives in fancy’s seeing.
O wretched state of man in self-division!

Thyrsis: O wretched state of man in self-division!
O well thou say'st! A feeling declaration 
Thy tongue hath made of Cupid's deep incision.
But now hoarse voice doth fail this occupation,
And others long to tell their loves’ condition;
Of singing thou hast got the reputation.

Dorus: Of singing thou hast got the reputation,
Good Thyrsis mine; I yield to thy ability;
My heart doth seek another estimation.
But ah, my Muse, I would thou had’st facility 
To work my Goddess so by thy invention,
On me to cast those eyes where shine nobility:
Seen and unknown; heard, but without attention.
   
   
   Dorus did so well in answering Thyrsis that everyone desired to hear him sing something alone. Seeing therefore a lute lying under the Princess Pamela’s feet, glad to have such an errand to approach her, he came, but came with a dismayed grace, all his blood stirred betwixt fear and desire; and playing upon it with such sweetness as everybody wondered to see such skill in a shepherd, he sang unto it with a sorrowing voice these elegiac verses:

Dorus: Fortune, Nature, Love, long have contended about me, 
Which should most miseries cast on a worm that I am. 
Fortune thus gan say; 'Misery and misfortune is all one,
And of misfortune, Fortune hath only the gift.
With strong foes on land, on seas with contrary tempests 
Still do I cross this wretch, what so he taketh in hand.’
'Tush, tush,’ said Nature, ‘this is all but a trifle; a man’s self 
Gives haps or mishaps, even as he ordereth his heart,
But so his humour I frame, in a mould of choler adusted, 
That the delights of life shall be to him dolorous.’

Love smiled, and thus said; Want joined to Desire is unhappy: 
But if he nought do desire, what can Heraclitus ail? 
None but I works by Desire: by Desire have I kindled in his soul 
Infernal agonies unto a beauty divine.
Where thou, poor Nature, left’st all thy due glory to Fortune, 
Her vertue is sovereign, Fortune a vassal of hers.’
Nature abash’d went back: .Fortune blush’d; yet she replied thus: 
And even in that love shall I reserve him a spite.’
Thus, thus, alas, woeful in Nature, unhappy by Fortune,
But most wretched I am, now Love awakes my Desire.
   Dorus when he had sung this, having had all the while a free beholding of the fair Pamela (who could well have spared such honour, and defended the assault he gave unto her face with bringing a fair stain of shamefastness unto it) let fall his arms, and remained so fastened in his thoughts as if Pamela had grafted him there to grow in continual imagination. But Zelmane espying it and fearing he should too much forget himself, she came to him, and took out of his hand the lute, and laying fast hold of Philoclea’s face with her eyes, she sung these Sapphics, speaking as it were to her own hope:

If mine eyes can speak to do hearty errand,
Or mine eyes’ language she do hap to judge of,
So that eyes’ message be of her received, 	
       Hope, we do live yet. 
But if eyes fail then, when I most do need them,
Or if eyes’ language be not unto her known,
So that eyes’ message do return rejected,
       Hope, we do both die. 
Yet dying, and dead, do we sing her honour;
So become our tombs monuments of her praise;
So becomes our loss the triumph of her gain;
       Hers be the glory.
If the spheres senseless do yet hold a music,
If the swan’s sweet voice be not heard, but at death,
If the mute timber when it hath the life lost
       Yieldeth a lute’s tune, 
Are then human minds privileg’d so meanly,
As that hateful death can abridge them of power 
With the voice of truth to record to all worlds
       That we be her spoils? 
Thus not ending ends the due praise of her praise: 
Fleshly veil consumes; but a soul hath his life,
Which is held in love; love it is that hath join’d
       Life to this our soul.
But if eyes can speak to do hearty errand,
Or mine eyes’ language she do hap to judge of,
So that eyes’ message be of her received
       Hope, we do live yet.
   Great was the pleasure of Basilius, and greater would have been Gynecia’s but that she found too well it was intended to her daughter. As for Philoclea, she was sweetly ravished withal.  When Dorus, desiring in a secret manner to speak of their cases as perchance the parties intended might take some light of it, making low reverence to Zelmane, began this provoking song in Hexameter verse unto her; whereunto she soon finding whither his words were directed, in like tune and verse answered as followeth:
   DORUS • ZELMANE

Dorus: Lady reserved by the heavens to do pastor's company honour,
Joining your sweet voice to the rural muse of a desert,
Here you fully do find this strange operation of love,
How to the woods love runs as well as rides to the palace; 
Neither he bears reverence to a prince, nor pity to a beggar,
But, like a point in midst of a circle, is still of a nearness;
All to a lesson he draws; neither hills nor caves can avoid him.

Zelmane: Worthy shepherd by my song to myself all favour is happ’ned,
That to the sacred Muse my annoys somewhat be revealed, 
Sacred Muse, who in one contains what nine do in all them.
But O, happy be you, which safe from fiery reflection 
Of Phoebus’ violence in shade of sweet Cyparissus,
Or pleasant myrtle, may teach the unfortunate Echo 
In these woods to resound the renowned name of a goddess. 
Happy be you that may to the saint, your only Idea, 
(Although simply attired) your manly affection utter.
Happy be those mishaps which, justly proportion holding,
Give right sound to the ears, and enter aright to the judgement: 
But wretched be the souls which, veiled in a contrary subject, 
How much more we do love, so the less our loves be believed. 
What skill salveth a sore of a wrong infirmity judged?
What can justice avail to a man that tells not his own case?
You though fears do abash, in you still possible hopes be:
Nature against we do seem to rebel, seem fools in a vain suit.
But so unheard, condemn’d, kept thence we do seek to abide in,
Self-lost in wand’ring, banished that place we do come from, 
What mean is there, alas, we can hope our loss to recover?
What place is there left we may hope our woes to recomfort? 
Unto the heav’ns? Our wings be too short: th’ earth thinks us a burden:
Air? We do still with sighs increase: to the fire? We do want none:
And yet his outward heat our tears would quench, but an inward
Fire no liquor can cool: Neptune’s realm would not avail us. 
Happy shepherd, with thanks to the Gods, still think to be thankful,
That to thy advancement their wisdoms have thee abased.

Dorus: Unto the gods with a thankful heart all thanks; I do render,
That to my advancement their wisdoms have me abased.
But yet, alas, O but yet, alas, our haps be but hard haps,
Which must frame contempt to the fittest purchase of honour. 
Well may a pastor plain, but alas his plaints be not esteem’d: 
Silly shepherd's poor pipe, when his harsh sound testifies anguish,
Into the fair looker-on, pastime, not passion, enters.
And to the woods or brooks, who do make such dreary recital 
What be the pangs they bear, and whence those pangs be derived,
Pleas’d to receive that name by rebounding answer of Echo,
May hope thereby to ease their inward horrible anguish 
When trees dance to the pipe, and swift streams stay by the music,
Or when an Echo begins unmov’d to sing them a love-song.
Say then, what vantage do we get by the trade of a pastor,
(Since no estates be so base, but love vouchsafeth his arrow,
Since no refuge doth serve from wounds we do carry about us, 
Since outward pleasures be but halting helps to decayed souls)
Save that daily we may discern what fire we do burn in?
Far more happy be you, whose greatness gets a free access, 
Whose fair bodily gifts are fram'd most lovely to each eye. 
Virtue you have, of virtue you have left proof to the whole world,
And virtue is grateful, with beauty and richness adorn'd. 
Neither doubt you a whit, time will your passion utter. 
Hardly remains fire hid where skill is bent to the hiding,
But in a mind that would his flames should not be repressed, 
Nature worketh enough with a small help for the revealing. 
Give therefore to the Muse great praise, in whose very likeness 
You do approach to the fruit your only desires be to gather.

Zelmane: First shall fertile grounds not yield increase of a good seed,
First the rivers shall cease to repay their floods to the ocean,
First may a trusty greyhound transform himself to a tiger,
First shall virtue be vice, and beauty be counted a blemish,
Ere that I leave with song of praise her praise to solemnize,
Her praise, whence to the world all praise hath his only beginning:
But yet well I do find each man most wise in his own case.
None can speak of a wound with skill, if he have not a wound felt.
Great to thee my state seems, thy state is blest by my judgement:
And yet neither of us great or blest deemeth his own self.
For yet (weigh this, alas) great is not great to the greater.
What judge you doth a hillock show by the lofty Olympus? 
Such my minute greatness doth seem compar’d to the greatest. 
When cedars to the ground fall down by the weight of an emmot,
Or when a rich ruby’s price be the worth of a walnut,
Or to the sun for wonders seem small sparks of a candle,
Then by my high cedar, rich ruby, and only shining sun,
Virtue, richess, beauties of mine shall great be reputed.
Oh, no, no, worthy shepherd, worth can never enter a title,
Where proofs justly do teach, thus match’d, such worth to be nought worth.
Let not a puppet abuse thy sprite; kings’ crowns do not help them
From the cruel headache, nor shoes of gold do the gout heal, 
And precious couches full oft are shak’d with a fever.
If then a bodily evil in a bodily gloss be not hidden,
Shall such morning dews be an ease to the heat of a love’s fire?

DORUS: O glittering miseries of man, if this be the fortune 
Of those fortune lulls, so small rest rests in a kingdom,
What marvel tho’ a prince transform himself to a pastor,
Come from marble bowers, many times the gay harbour of anguish,
Unto a silly cabin, though weak, yet stronger against woes? 
Now by thy words I begin, most famous lady, to gather 
Comfort into my souL I do find, I do find what a blessing 
Is chanced to my life, that from such muddy abundance 
Of carking agonies to estates which still be adherent,
Destiny keeps me aloof: for if all this estate to thy virtue 
Join’d, by thy beauty adorn’d, be no means those griefs to abolish;
If neither by that help, thou canst climb up to thy fancy,
Nor yet fancy so dress’d do receive more plausible hearing,
Then do I think indeed that better it is to be private 
In sorrow’s torments, than, tied to the pomps of a palace,
Nurse inward maladies, which have not scope to be breath’d out,
But perforce digest all bitter juices of horror 
In silence, from a man’s own self with company robbed.
Better yet do I live, that though by my thoughts I be plunged 
Into my life's bondage, yet may I disburden a passion 
(Oppress’d with ruinous conceits) by the help of an out-cry:
Not limited to a whispering note, the lament of a courtier,
With bold clamour unheard, unmark’d, what I seek, what I suffer:
And when I meet these trees, in the earth’s fair livery clothed, 
Ease I do feel (such ease as falls to one wholly diseased)
For that I find in them part of my stte represented.
Laurel shows what I seek; by the myrrh is showed how I seek it;
Olive paints me the peace that I must aspire to by conquest: 
Myrtle makes my request; my request is crown’d with a willow. 
Cypress promiseth help, but a help where comes no recomfort: 
Sweet juniper saith this, ‘Though I burn, yet I burn in a sweet fire.’
Yew doth make me think what kind of bow the boy holdeth, 
Which shoots strongly without any noise, and deadly without smart.
Fir-trees great and green, fix’d on a high hill but a barren,
Like to my noble thoughts, still new, well plac’d, to me fruitless. 
Fig that yields most pleasant fruit, his shadow is hurtful:
Thus be her gifts most sweet, thus more danger to be near her. 
But in a palm when I mark how he doth rise under a burden, 
And may I not (say I then) get up though griefs be so weighty? 
Pine is a mast to a ship: to my ship shall hope for a mast serve? 
Pine is high, hope is as high; sharp leav’d, sharp yet be my hope’s buds.
Elm embrac’d by a vine, embracing fancy reviveth:
Poplar changeth his hue from a rising sun to a setting:
Thus to my sun do I yield, such looks her beams do afford me. 
Old aged oak cut down of new works serves to the building:
So my desires by my fear cut down, be the frames of her honour. 
Ash makes spears which shields do resist; her force no repulse takes.
Palms do rejoice to be join’d by the match of a male to a female, 
And shall sensive things be so senseless as to resist sense?
Thus be my thoughts dispers’d, thus thinking nurseth a think-
Thus both trees and each thing else be the books of a fancy.
But to the cedar, queen of woods, when I lift my be-tear’d eyes,
Then do I shape to myself that form which reigns so within me, 
And think there she do dwell and hear what plaints I do utter: 
When that noble top doth nod, I believe she salutes me;
When by the wind it maketh a noise, I do think she doth answer.
Then kneeling to the ground, oft thus do I speak to that image; 
‘Only jewel, O only jewel, which only deservest 
That men’s hearts be thy seat, and endless fame be thy servant,
O descend for a while, from this great height to behold me,
But nought else do behold (else is nought worth the beholding) 
Save what a work by thyself is wrought: and since I am alter’d 
Thus by thy work, disdain not that which is by thyself done.
In mean caves oft treasure abides; to an hostry a king comes. 
And so behind foul clouds full oft fair stars do lie hidden.

Zelmane: Hardy shepherd, such as thy merits, such may be her insight
Justly to grant thee reward, such envy I bear to thy fortune.
But to myself what wish can I make for a salve to my sorrows, 
Whom both nature seems to debar from means to be helped,
And if a mean were found, fortune th’ whole course of it hinders?
Thus plagu’d how can I frame to my sore any hope of amendment?
Whence may I show to my mind any light of possible escape? 
Bound, and bound by so noble bands, as loth to be unbound, 
Jailer I am to myself, prison and prisoner to mine own self.
Yet be my hopes thus plac’d, here fix’d lives all my recomfort, 
That that dear diamond, where wisdom holdeth a sure seat, 
Whose force had such force so to transform, nay to reform me, 
Will at length perceive those flames by her beams to be kindled,
And will pity the wound festered so strangely within me.
O be it so, grant such an event, O gods, that event give,
And for a sure sacrifice I do daily oblation offer 
Of mine own heart, where thoughts be the temple, sight is an altar.
But cease worthy shepherd, now cease we to weary the hearers 
With moanful melodies; for enough our griefs be revealed,
If the parties meant our meanings rightly be marked,
And sorrows do require some respite unto the senses.
   What exclaiming praises Basilius gave to this Eclogue any man may guess that knows love is better than a pair of spectacles to make everything seem greater which is seen through it, and then is never tongue-tied where fit commendation (whereof womankind is so lickerous) is offered unto it. But before any other came in to supply the place, Zelmane, having heard some of the shepherds by chance name Strephon and Claius, supposing thereby they had been present, was desirous both to hear them for the fame of their friendly love and to know them for their kindness towards her best loved friend. Much grieved was Basilius that any desire of his mistress should be unsatisfied, and therefore to represent them unto her (as well as in their absence it might be) he commanded on Lamon, who had at large set down their country pastimes and first love to Urania, to sing the whole discourse, which he did in this manner:
   
A shepherd's tale no height of style desires, 
To raise in words what in effect is low.
A plaining song plain-singing voice requires,
For warbling notes from inward cheering flow.
I then, whose burd’ned breast but thus aspires 
Of shepherds two the silly case to show,
Need not the stately Muse’s help invoke
For creeping rhymes, which often sighings choke.
But you, O you, that think not tears too dear 
To spend for harms, although they touch you not,
And deign to deem your neighbours' mischief near,
Although they be of meaner parents got,
You I invite with easy ears to hear 
The poor-clad truth of love’s wrong-order’d lot.
Who may be glad, be glad you be not such:
Who share in woe, weigh others have as much.
There was (O seldom blessed word of was!)
A pair of friends, or rather one call’d two,
Train’d in the life which on short-bitten grass 
In shine or storm must set the clouted shoe:
He, that the other in some years did pass,
And in those gifts that years distribute do,
Was Claius call’d (ah, Claius, woeful wight!)
The later bom, yet too soon, Strephon hight,
Epirus high was honest Claius’ nest,
To Strephon Aeoles’ land first breathing lent:
But east and west were join’d by friendship’s hest.
As Strephon’s ear and heart to Claius bent,
So Claius’ soul did in his Strephon rest.
Still both their flocks flocking together went,
As if they would of owners' humour be,
And eke their pipes did well, as friends, agree.
Claius for skill of herbs and shepherd’s art 
Among the wisest was accounted wise,
Yet not so wise as of unstained heart:
Strephon was young, yet marked with humble eyes 
How elder rul'd their flocks and cur'd their smart,
So that the grave did not his words despise.
Both free of mind, both did clear dealing love,
And both had skill in verse their voice to move.
Their cheerful minds, 'till poison’d was their cheer,
The honest sports of earthy lodging prove;
Now for a clod-like hare in form they peer,
Now bolt and cudgel squirrels’ leap do move:
Now the ambitious lark with mirror clear 
They catch, while he (fool!) to himself makes love:
And now at keels they try a harmless chance,
And now their cur they teach to fetch and dance.
When merry May first early calls the morn,
With merry maids a maying they do go:
Then do they pull from sharp and niggard thorn
The plenteous sweets (can sweets so sharply grow?)
Then some green gowns are by the lasses worn 
In chastest plays, 'till home they walk a row,
While dance about the may-pole is begun,
When, if need were, they could at Quintain run.
While thus they ran a low but levell’d race,
While thus they liv’d (this was indeed a life)
With nature pleas’d, content with present case,
Free of proud fears, brave begg’ry, smiling strife 
Of climb-fall court, the envy hatching place;
While those restless desires in great men rife,
To visit so low folks did much disdain,
This while, though poor, they in themselves did reign.
One day (O day, that shin’d to make them dark!)
While they did ward sun-beams with shady bay,
And Claius taking for his younglings cark,
(Lest greedy eyes to them might challenge lay)
Busy with oker did their shoulders mark,
(His mark a pillar was devoid of stay, 
As bragging that free of all passions' moan,
Well might he others bear, but lean to none)
Strephon with leafy twigs of laurel tree 
A garland made on temples for to wear,
For he then chosen was the dignity
Of village lord that Whitsuntide to bear;
And full, poor fools, of boyish bravery,
With triumph’s shows would show he nought did fear.
But fore-accounting oft makes builders miss:
They found, they felt, they had no lease of bliss.
For ere that either had his purpose done,
Behold (beholding well it doth deserve)
They saw a maid who thitherward did run
To catch her Sparrow which from her did swerve,
As she a black-silk cap on him begun 
To set for foil of his milk-white to serve.
She chirping ran, he peeping flew away,
’Till hard by them both he and she did stay.
Well for to see, they kept themselves unseen,
And saw this fairest maid of fairer mind,
By fortune mean, in nature bom a queen,
How well apaid she was her bird to find:
How tenderly her tender hands between 
In ivory cage she did the micher bind:
How rosy moist'ned lips about his beak 
Moving, she seem'd at once to kiss, and speak.
Chast’ned but thus, and thus his lesson taught,
The happy wretch she put into her breast,
Which to their eyes the bowls of Venus brought,
For they seem'd made even of sky metal best,
And that the biaj of her blood was wrought.
Betwixt them two the peeper took his nest, «.
Where snugging well he well appear’d content 
So to have done amiss, so to be shent.
This done, but done with captive-killing grace,
Each motion seeming shot from beauty’s bow,
With length laid down, she deck’d the lonely place.
Proud grew the grass that under her did grow,
The trees spread out their arms to shade her face,
But she on elbow lean’d, with sighs did show 
No grass, no trees, nor yet her sparrow might 
To long-perplexed mind breed long delight 
She troubled was (alas that it might be!)
With tedious brawlings of her parents dear,
Who would have her in will and word agree 
To wed Antaxius their neighbour near.
A herdman rich, of much account was he,
In whom no evil did reign, nor good appear.
In some such one she lik’d not his desire,
Fain would be free, but dreadeth parents' ire.
Kindly, sweet soul, she did unkindness take 
That bagged baggage of a miser’s mud
Should price of her, as in a market, make;
But gold can gild a rotten piece of wood.
To yield she found her noble heart to ache:
To strive she fear’d how it with virtue stood.
These doubting clouds o'ercasting heav’nly brain, 
At length in rows of kiss-cheek tears they rain. 
Cupid the wag, that lately conquer’d had 
Wise counsellors, stout captains, puissant kings, 
And tied them fast to lead his triumph bad,
Glutted with them, now plays with meanest things. 
So oft in feasts with costly changes clad 
To crammed maws a sprat new stomach brings:
So lords, with sport of stag and heron full, 
Sometimes we see small birds from nests do pull. 
So now for prey these shepherds two he took,
Whose metal stiff he knew he could not bend 
With hear-say pictures, or a window-look;
With one good dance, or letter finely penn'd 
That were in court a well proportion’d hook,
Where piercing wits do quickly apprehend:
Their senses rude plain objects only move,
And so must see great cause before they love. 
Therefore love arm'd in her now takes the field, 
Making her beams his bravery and might:
Her hands which pierc’d the soxd’s sev’n-double shield, 
Were now his darts, leaving his wonted fight.
Brave crest to him her scom-gold hair did yield,
His complete harness was her purest white;
But fearing lest all white might seem too good,
In cheeks and lips the tyrant threatens blood. 
Besides this force, within her eyes he kept 
A fire, to bum the prisoners he gains,
Whose boiling heat increased as she wept:
For ev’n in forge, cold water fire maintains.
Thus proud and fierce unto the hearts he stepp’d 
Of them, poor souls; and cutting reason's reins, 
Made them his own before they had it wist. 
But if they had, could sheep-hooks this resist?
Claius straight felt, and groaned at the blow,
And call’d, now wounded, purpose to his aid:
Strephon, fond boy, delighted, did not know 
That it was love that shin’d in shining maid:
But lickerous, poison'd, fain to her would go,
If him new-learned manners had not stay’d.
For then Urania homeward did arise,
Leaving in pain their well-fed hungry eyes.
She went, they stay’d, or rightly for to say,
She stay'd in them, they went in thought with her:
Claius indeed would fain have pull’d away 
This mote from out his eye, this inward bur,
And now, proud rebel, ’gan for to gainsay 
The lesson winch but late he leam’d too far;
Meaning with absence to refresh the thought 
To which her presence such a fever brought.
Strephon did leap with joy and jollity,
Thinking it just more therein to delight 
Than in good dog, fair field, or shading tree.
So have I seen trim books in velvet dight,
With golden leaves and painted babery,
Of silly boys please unacquainted sight;
But when the rod began to play his part,
Fain would, but could not, fly from golden smart.
He quickly learn’d Urania was her name,
And straight, for failing, grav’d it in his heart:
He knew her haunt, and haunted in the same,
And taught his sheep her sheep in food to thwart,
Which soon as it did hateful question frame,
He might on knees confess his faulty part,
And yield himself unto her punishment,
While nought but game the self-hurt wanton meant.
Nay, even unto her home he oft would go,
Where bold and hurtless many plays he tries,
Her parents liking well it should be so,
For simple goodness shined in his eyes.
There did he make her laugh in spite of woe,
So as good thoughts of him in all arise,
While into none doubt of his love did sink,
For not himself to be in love did think.
But glad desire, his late embosom’d guest 
Yet but a babe, with milk of sight he nurst:
Desire the more he suck’d, more sought the breast,
Like dropsy-folk still drink to be athirst 
'Till one fair ev’n an hour ere sun did rest,
Who then in Lion’s cave did enter first 
By neighbours pray’d, she went abroad thereby,
At Barley-brake hei sweet swift foot to try.
Never the earth on his round shoulders bare 
A maid train'd up from high or low degree,
That in her doings better could compare 
Mirth with respect, few words with courtesy,
A careless comeliness with comely care,
Self-guard with mildness, sport with majesty:
Which made her yield to deck this shepherd's band, 
And still, believe me, Strephon was at hand.
A-field they go, where many lookers be,
And thou, seek-sorrow Claius, them among 
Indeed thou said’st it was thy friend to see,
Strephon, whose absence seem'd unto thee long,
While most with her he less did keep with thee.
No, no, it was in spite of wisdom’s song
Which absence wish'd: love play’d a victor's part: 
The heav'n-love lode-stone drew thy iron heart 
Then couples three be straight allotted there,
They of both ends the middle two do fly;
They two that in mid-place, Hell called were,
Must strive with waiting foot, and watching eye 
To catch of them, and them to hell to bear,
That they, as well as they, hell may supply:
Like some which seek to salve their blotted name 
With others’ blot, ’till all do taste of shame.
There may you see, soon as the middle two 
Do coupled towards either couple make,
They false and fearful do their hands undo,
Brother his brother, friend doth friend forsake,
Heeding himself, cares not how fellow do,
But of a stranger mutual help doth take:
As perjur’d cowards in adversity
With sight of fear, from friends to fremd do fly.
These sports shepherds devis'd such faults to show.
Geron, though old yet gamesome, kept one end 
With Cosma, for whose love Pas passed in woe.
Fair Nous with Pas the lot to hell did send:
Pas thought it hell while he was Cosma fro.
At other end Uran did Strephon lend
Her happy-making hand, of whom one look 
From Nous and Cosma all their beauty took.
The play began: Pas durst not Cosma chase,
But did intend next bout with her to meet,
So he with Nous to Geron turn’d their race,
With whom to join fast ran Urania sweet:
But light legg’d Pas had got the middle space.
Geron strove hard, but aged were his feet,
And therefore finding force now faint to be,
He thought gray hairs afforded subdety.
And so when Pas hand-reached him to take,
The fox on knees and elbows tumbled down;
Pas could not stay, but over him did rake,
And crown’d the earth with his first touching crown:
His heels grown proud did seem t heav'n to shake,
But Nous that slipp’d from Pas, did catch the clown.
So laughing all, yet Pas to ease somedel,
Geron with Uran were condemn’d to hell.
Cosma this while to Strephon safely came,
And all to second Barley-brake are bent:
The two in hell did toward Cosma frame,
Who should to Pas, but they would her prevent.
Pas mad with fall, and madder with the shame,
Most mad with beams which he thought Cosma sent, 
With such mad haste he did to Cosma go,
That to her breast he gave a noisome blow.
She quick and proud, and who did Pas despise,
Up with her fist, and took him on the face;
Another time,’ quoth she, ‘become more wise.’
Thus Pas did kiss her hand with little grace,
And each way luckless, yet in humble guise 
Did hold her fast for fear of more disgrace,
While Strephon might with pretty Nous have met,
But all this while another course he fet
For as Urania after Cosma ran,
He, ravished with sight how gracefully 
She mov’d her limbs and drew the aged man,
Left Nous to coast the loved beauty nigh.
Nous cry’d and chaf'd, but he no other can.
'Till Uran seeing Pas to Cosma fly,
And Strephon single, turn’d after him:
Strephon so chas’d did seem in milk to swim.
He ran, but ran with eye o’er shoulder cast,
More marking her than how himself did go,
Like Numid lions by the hunters chas’d,
Though they do fly, yet backwardly do glow
With proud aspect, disdaining greatest haste:
What rage in them, that love in him did show.
But God gives them instinct the man to shun,
And he by law of Barley-brake must run.
But as his heat with running did augment,
Much more his sight increas'd his hot desire:
So is in her the best of Nature spent,
The air her sweet race mov'd doth blow the fire.
Her feet be pursuivants from Cupid sent,
With whose fine steps all loves and joys conspire.
The hidden beauties seem’d in wait to he,
To down proud hearts that would not willing die.
Thus, fast he fled from her he follow'd sore,
Still shunning Nous to lengthen pleasing race,
Till that he spied old Geron could no more,
Then did he slack his love-instructed pace.
So that Uran, whose arm old Geron bore,
Laid hold on him with most lay-holding grace.
So caught, him seem’d he caught of joys the bell, 
And thought it heav’n so to be drawn to hell. 
To hell he goes, and Nous with him must dwell.
Nous sware it was no right; for his default 
Who would be caught, that she should go to hell:
But so she must. And now the third assault 
Of Barley-brake among the six befell.
Pas Cosma match’d, yet angry with his fault,
The other end Geron with Uran guard:
I think you think Strephon bent thitherward. 
Nous counsell’d Strephon Geron to pursue,
For he was old, and easily would be caught 
But he drew her as love his fancy drew,
And so to take the gem Urania sought,
While Geron old came safe to Cosma true,
Though him to meet at all she stirred nought 
For Pas, whether it were for fear or love,
Mov’d not himself, nor suffer’d her to move.
So they three did together idly stay,
While dear Uran, whose course was Pas to meet,
(He staying thus) was fain abroad to stray 
With larger round, to shim the following feet. 
Strephon, whose eyes on her back parts did play,
With love drawn on, so fast with pace unmeet 
Drew dainty Nous, that she not able so 
To run, brake forth his hands, and let him go.
He single thus hop’d soon with her to be,
Who nothing earthly, but of fire and air,
Though with soft legs, did run as fast as he.
He thrice reach’d, thrice deceiv’d, when her to bear 
He hopes, with dainty turns she doth him flee.
So on the Downs we see, near Wilton fair,
A hasten’d hare from greedy greyhound go,
And oast all hope his chaps to frustrate so.
But this strange race more strange conceits did yield:
Who victor seem’d was to his ruin brought:
Who seem’d o’erthrown was mistress of the field:
She fled, and took; he followed and was caught.
So have I heard to pierce pursuing shield,
By parents train’d, the Tartars wild are taught,
With shafts shot out from their back-turned bow.
But ah! Her darts did far more deeply go.
As Venus’ bird, the white, swift, lovely Dove,
(O happy Dove that art compar’d to her!)
Doth on her wings her utmost swiftness prove,
Finding the gripe of Falcon fierce not far;
So did Uran: the nar, the swifter move,
(Yet beauty still as fast as she did stir)
’Till with long race dear she was breathless brought, 
And then the Phoenix feared to be caught.
Among the rest that there did take delight 
To see the sports of double shining day,
And did the tribute of their wond’ring sight 
To Nature’s heir, the fair Urania, pay,
I told you Claius was the hapless wight,
Who earnest found what they accounted play.
He did not there do homage of his eyes,
But on his eyes his heart did sacrifice.
With gazing looks, short sighs, unsettled feet,
He stood, but turn’d, as Gyrosol, to sun:
His fancies still did her in half-way meet,
His soxd did fly as she was seen to run.
In sum, proud Boreas never ruled fleet 
(Who Neptune’s web on danger’s distaff spun)
With greater power than she did make them wend 
Each way, as she, that age’s praise, did bend.
'Till ’spying well she well nigh weary was,
And surely taught by his love-open eye,
His eye, that ev’n did mark her trodden grass,
That she would fain the catch of Strephon fly,
Giving his reason passport for to pass 
Whither it would, so it would let him die;
He that before shunn’d her, to shun such harms,
Now runs, and takes her in his clipping arms.
For with pretence from Strephon her to guard,
He met her full, but full of warefulness,
With inbowed bosom well for her prepar’d,
When Strephon cursing his own backwardness,
Came to her back, and so with double ward 
Imprison her who both them did possess 
As heart-bound slaves: and happy then embrace 
Virtue’s proof, fortune’s victor, beauty’s place.
Her race did not her beauty’s beams augment,
For they were ever in the best degree,
But yet a setting forth it someway lent,
As rubies lustre when they rubbed be.
The dainty dew on face and body went 
As on sweet flower, when morning’s drops we see.
Her breath, then short, seem’d loth from home to pass, 
Which more it mov’d, the more it sweeter was.
Happy, O happy! if they so might bide 
To see her eyes, with how true humbleness 
They looked down to triumph over pride;
With how sweet saws she blam’d their sauciness;
To feel the panting heart, which through her side,
Did beat their hands, which durst so near to press;
To see, to feel, to hear, to taste, to know 
More than, besides her, all the earth could show.
But never did Medea’s golden weed
On Creon’s child his poison sooner throw, 
Than those delights through all their sinews breed 
A creeping serpent-like of mortal woe,
’Till she brake from their arms (although indeed 
Going from them, from them she could not go)
And fare-welling the flock, did homeward wend,
And so that even the Barley-brake did end.
It ended, but the others’ woe began,
Began at least to be conceiv’d as woe,
For then wise Claius found no absence can 
Help him who can no more her sight forgo.
He found man’s virtue is but part of man,
And part must follow where whole man doth go.
He found that reason’s self now reasons found 
To fasten knots, which fancy first had bound.
So doth he yield, so takes he on his yoke,
Not knowing who did draw with him therein; 
Strephon, poor youth, because he saw no smoke,
Did not conceive what fire he had within:
But after this to greater rage it broke,
'Till of his life it did full conquest win,
First killing mirth, then banishing all rest,
Filling his eyes with tears, with sighs his breast. 
Then sports grew pains, all talking tedious:
On thoughts he feeds, his looks their figure change, 
The day seems long, but night is odious,
No sleeps, but dreams; no dreams, but visions strange, 
’Till finding still his evil increasing thus,
One day he with his flock abroad did range:
And coming where he hop’d to be alone,
Thus on a hillock set, he made his moan:
‘Alas! what weights are these that load my heart!
am as dull as winter-starved sheep,
Tir’d as a jade in over-laden cart,
Yet thoughts do fly, though I can scarcely creep.
All visions seem, at every bush I start:
Drowsy am I, and yet can rarely sleep.
Sure I bewitched am, it is even that:
Late near a cross I met an ugly cat 
For, but by charms, how fall these things on me,
That from those eyes, where heav’nly apples been, 
Those eyes, which nothing like themselves can see,
Of fair Urania, fairer than a green,
Proudly bedeck'd in April's livery,



A shot unheard gave me a wound unseen?
He was invisible that hurt me so,
And none invisible, but spirits can go.
When I see her, my sinews shake for fear,
And yet, dear soul, I know she hurteth none:
Amid my flock with woe my voice I tear,
And, but bewitch'd, who to his flock would moan? 
Her cherry lips, milk hands, and golden hair
I still do see, though I be still alone.
Now make me think that there is not a fiend,
Who hid in angel’s shape my life would end.
The sports wherein I wonted to do well,
Come she, and sweet the air with open breast,
Then so I fail, when most I would do well,
That at me  amaz'd my fellows jest:
Sometimes to her news of myself to tell
I go about, but then is all my best 
Wry words, and stammering, or else doltish dumb: 
Say then, can this but of enchantment come?
Nay each thing is bewitched to know my case:
The Nightingales for woe their songs refrain:
In river as I look'd my pining face,
As pin'd a face as mine I saw again.
The courteous mountains, griev’d at my disgrace, 
Their snowy hair tear off in melting pain.
And now the dropping trees do weep for me,
And now fair evenings blush my shame to see.
But you my pipe, whilom my chief delight,
'Till strange delight, delight to nothing wear;
And you my flock, care of my careful sight,
While I was I, and so had cause to care;
And thou my dog, whose truth and valiant might 
Made wolves (not inward wolves) my ewes to spare; 
Go you not from your master in his woe,
Let it suffice that he himself forgo.
For though like wax this magic makes me waste,
Or like a lamb, whose dam away is fet,
(Stolen from her young by thieves’ unchoosing haste)
He treble baas for help, but none can get;
Though thus, and worse, though now I am at last,
Of all the games that here ere now I met,
Do you remember still you once were mine,
’Till my eyes had their curse from blessed eyne.
Be you with me while I unheard do cry,
While I do score my losses on the wind,
While I in heart my will write ere I die.
In which, by will, my will and wits I bind 
Still to be hers, about her aye to fly,
As this same sprite about my fancies blind 
Doth daily haunt, but so, that mine become 
As much more loving, as less cumbersome.
Alas, a cloud hath overcast mine eyes:
And yet I see her shine amid the cloud.
Alas, of ghosts I hear the ghastly cries:
Yet there, me seems, I hear her singing loud.
This song she sings in most commanding wise:
“Come shepherd’s boy, let now thy heart be bow’d 
To make itself to my least look a slave:
Leave sleep, leave all, I will no piecing have.”
I will, I will, alas, alas, I will:
Wilt thou have more? More have, if more I be.
Away ragg'd rams, care I what murrain kill!
Out shrieking pipe made of some witched tree!
Go bawling cur, thy hungry maw go fill 
On yond foul flock, belonging not to me!’
With that his dog he henc’d, his flock he curs’d, 
With that, yet kissed first, his pipe he burst.
This said, this done, he rose, even tir’d with rest,
With heart as careful, as with careless grace,
With shrinking legs, but with a swelling breast,
With eyes which threat’ned they would drown his face, 
Fearing the worst, not knowing what were best,
And giving to his sight a wand’ring race,
He saw behind a bush where Claius sat,
His well-known friend, but yet his unknown mate:
Claius the wretch, who lately yielden was
To bear the bonds which time nor wit could break,
(With blushing soul at sight of judgement’s glass,
While guilty thoughts accus’d his reason weak)
This morn alone to lonely walk did pass,
Within himself of her dear self to speak,
’Till Strephon’s plaining voice him nearer drew,
Where by his words his self-like cause he knew.
For hearing him so oft with words of woe 
Urania name, whose force he knew so well,
He quickly knew what witchcraft gave the blow,
Which made his Strephon think himself in hell.
Which when he did in perfect image show 
To his own wit, thought upon thought did swell,
Breeding huge storms within his inward part,
Which thus breath’d out, with earth-quake of his heart.	
   As Lamon would have proceeded, Basilius, knowing by the wasting of the torches that the night also was far wasted, and withal remembering Zelmane’s hurt, asked her whether she thought it not better to reserve the complaint of Claius till another day. Which she, perceiving the song had already worn out much time, and not knowing when Lamon would end, being even now stepping over to a new matter, though much delighted with what was spoken, willingly agreed unto. And so of all sides they went to recommend themselves to the elder brother of death.
   THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK
   
   The Second Book of the Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia
   CHAPTER 1
   In these pastoral pastimes a great number of days were sent to follow their flying predecessors, while the cup of poison (which was deeply tasted of this noble company) had left no sinew of theirs without mortally searching into it; yet never manifesting his venomous work, till once that the night (parting away angry that she could distil no more sleep into the eyes of lovers) had no sooner given place to the breaking out of the morning light and the sun bestowed his beams upon the tops of the mountains, but that the woeful Gynecia (to whom rest was no ease) had left her loathed lodging and gotten herself into the solitary places those deserts were full of, going up and down with such unquiet motions as a grieved and hopeless mind is wont to bring forth. There appeared unto the eyes of her judgement the evils she was like to run into, with ugly infamy waiting upon them: she felt the terrors of her own conscience; she was guilty of a long exercised virtue which made this vice the fuller of deformity. The uttermost of the good she could aspire unto was a mortal wound to her vexed spirits; and lastly, no small part of her evils was that she was wise to see her evils. Insomuch that, having a great while thrown her countenance ghastly about her (as if she had called all the powers of the world to be witness of her wretched estate) at length casting up her watery eyes to heaven:
   ‘O sun,' said she, ‘whose unspotted light directs the steps of mortal mankind, art thou not ashamed to impart the clearness of thy presence to such a dust-creeping worm as I am? O you heavens, which continually keep the course allotted unto you, can none of your influences prevail so much upon the miserable Gynecia as to make her preserve a course so long embraced by her? O deserts, deserts, how fit a guest am I for you, since my heart can people you with wild ravenous beasts, which in you are wanting!
   O virtue, where dost thou hide thyself? What hideous thing is this which doth eclipse thee? Or is it true that thou wert never but a vain name and no essential thing, which hast thus left thy professed servant when she had most need of thy lovely presence?
   O imperfect proportion of reason which can too much foresee and too little prevent! Alas, alas,' said she, ‘if there were but one hope for all my pains or but one excuse for all my faultiness! But wretch that I am, my torment is beyond all succour, and my evil deserving doth exceed my evil fortune. For nothing else did my husband take this strange resolution to live so solitarily. For nothing else have the winds delivered this strange guest to my country. For nothing else have the destinies reserved my life to this time, but that only I, most wretched I, should become a plague to myself and a shame to womankind. Yet if my desire, how unjust soever it be, might take effect, though a thousand deaths followed it and every death were followed with a thousand shames, yet should not my sepulchre receive me without some contentment. But alas, though sure I am that Zelmane is such as can answer my love, yet as sure I am that this disguising must needs come for some foretaken conceit. And then, wretched Gynecia, where canst thou find any small ground-plot for hope to dwell upon? No, no, it is Philoclea his heart is set upon; it is my daughter I have borne to supplant me. But if it be so, the life I have given thee, ungrateful Philoclea, I will sooner with these hands bereave thee of than my birth shall glory she hath bereaved me of my desires. In shame there is no comfort but to be beyond all bounds of shame.'
   Having spoken thus, she began to make a piteous war with her fair hair, when she might hear not far from her an extremely doleful voice, but so suppressed with a kind of whispering note that she could not conceive the words distinctly. But as a lamentable tune is the sweetest music to a woeful mind, she drew thither near-away in hope to find some companion of her misery; and as she paced on she was stopped with a number of trees so thickly placed together that she was afraid she should, with rushing through, stop the speech of the lamentable party which she was so desirous to understand. And therefore sitting her down as softly as she could (for she was now in distance to hear) she might first perceive a lute excellently well played upon, and then the same doleful voice accompanying it with these verses:
In vain, mine eyes, you labour to amend 
       With flowing tears your fault of hasty sight;
Since to my heart her shape you so did send,
       That her I see, though you did lose your light.

In vain, my heart, now you with sight are bum’d,
       With sighs you seek to cool your hot desire;
Since sighs, into mine inward furnace turn’d,
       For bellows serve to kindle more the fire.

Reason in vain, now you have lost my heart.
       My head you seek, as to your strongest fort;
Since there mine eyes have play’d so false a part,
       That to 	your strength your foes have sure resort.
       Then since in vain I find were all my strife,
       To this strange death I vainly yield my life.
   Hie ending of the song served but for a beginning of new plaints, as if the mind, oppressed with too heavy a burden of cares, was fain to discharge itself of all sides and, as it were, paint out the hideousness of the pain in all sorts of colours. For the woeful person (as if the lute had evil joined with the voice) threw it to the ground with such like words:
   ‘Alas, poor lute, how much art thou deceived to think that in my miseries thou could’st ease my woes, as in my careless times thou wast wont to please my fanciesIThe time is changed,my lute, the time is changed; and no more did my joyful mind then receive everything to a joyful consideration than my careful mind now makes each thing taste like the bitter juice of care The evil is inward, my lute, the evil is inward; which all thou dost doth serve but to make me think more freely of, and the more I think, the more cause I find of thinking, but less of hoping. And alas, what is then thy harmony but the sweet-meats of sorrow? The discord of my thoughts, my lute, doth ill agree to the concord of thy strings; therefore be not ashamed to leave thy master, since he is not afraid to forsake himself.
   And thus much spoken, instead of a conclusion was closed up with so hearty a groaning that Gyneria could not refrain to show herself, thinking such griefs could serve fitly for nothing but her own fortune. But as she came into the little arbour of this sorrowful music, her eyes met with the eyes of Zelmane which was the party that thus had indited herself of misery, so that either of them remained confused with a sudden astonishment, Zelmane fearing lest she had heard some part of those complaints which she had risen up that morning early of purpose to breathe out in secret to herself. But Gyneria a great while stood still with a kind of dull amazement, looking steadfastly upon her. At length returning to some use of herself, she began to ask Zelmane what cause carried her so early abroad. But, as if the opening of her mouth to Zelmane had opened some gTeat flood-gate of sorrow whereof her heart could not abide the violent issue, she sank to the ground with her hands over her face, crying vehemently, ‘Zelmane, help me, O Zelmane have pity on me!’
   Zelmane ran to her, marvelling what sudden sickness had thus possessed her; and beginning to ask her the cause of her pain and offering her service to be employed by her, Gyneria opening her eyes wildly upon her, pricked with the flames of love and the torments of her own conscience, ‘O Zelmane, Zelmane,’ said she, ‘dost thou offer me physic, which art my only poison? Or wilt thou do me service which hast already brought me into eternal slavery?’
   Zelmane then knowing well at what mark she shot, yet loth to enter into it; ‘Most excellent lady,’ said she, ‘you were best retire yourself into your lodging that you the better may pass this sudden fit.’
   ‘Retire myself?’ said Gynecia, Tf I had retired myself into myself when thou (to me unfortunate guest) earnest to draw me from myself, blessed had I been, and no need had I had of this counsel. But now alas, I am forced to fly to thee for succour whom I accuse of all my hurt, and make thee judge of my cause, who art the only author of my mischief.’
   Zelmane the more astonished, the more she understood her, ‘Madam,’ said she, ‘whereof do you accuse me that I will not clear myself? Or wherein may I stead you that you may not command me?'
   'Alas!’ answered Gyneria, ‘What shall I say more? Take pity of me, O Zelmane, but not as Zelmane, and disguise not with me in words, as I know thou dost in apparel.’
   Zelmane was much troubled with that word, finding herself brought to this strait. But as she was thinking what to answer her, they might see old Basilius pass hard by them without ever seeing them, complaining likewise of love very freshly, and ending his complaint with this song, love having renewed both his invention and voice:
Let not old age disgrace my high desire;
       O heavenly soul in human shape contain’d:
Old wood inflam'd doth yield the bravest fire,
       When younger doth in smoke his virtue spend,

Ne let white hairs which on my face do grow 
       Seem to your eyes of a disgraceful hue,
Since whiteness doth present the sweetest show,
       Which makes all eyes do homage unto you.

Old age is wise and full of constant truth;
       Old age well stayed from ranging humour lives;
Old age hath known whatever was in youth;
       Old age o'ercome, the greater honour gives.
       And to old age since you yourself aspire,
       Let not old age disgrace my high desire.
   Which being done, he looked very curiously upon himself, sometimes fetching a little skip as if he had said his strength had not yet forsaken him.
   But Zelmane, having in this time gotten some leisure to think for an answer, looking upon Gyneria as if she thought she did her some wrong: ‘Madam,’ said she, ‘I am not acquainted with those words of disguising; neither is it the profession of an Amazon; neither are you a party with whom it is to be used. If my service may please you, employ it, so long as you do me no wrong in misjudging of me.’
   ‘Alas, Zelmane,’ said Gynecia, ‘I perceive you know full little how piercing the eyes are of a true lover. There is no one beam of those thoughts you have planted in me but is able to discern a greater cloud than you do go in. Seek not to conceal yourself further from me, nor force not the passion of love into violent extremities.'
   Now was Zelmane brought to an exigent, when the king, turning his eyes that way through the trees, perceived his wife and mistress together; so that framing the most lovely countenance he could, he came straightway towards them, and at the first word, thanking his wife for having entertained Zelmane, desired her she would now return into the lodge because he had certain matters of estate to impart to the Lady Zelmane.The queen, being nothing troubled with jealousy in that point, obeyed the king’s commandment, full of raging agonies, and determinately bent that as she would seek all loving means to win Zelmane, so she would stir up terrible tragedies rather than fail of her intent. And so went she from them to the lodge-ward; with such a battle in her thoughts and so deadly an overthrow given to her best resolutions that even her body (where the field was fought) was oppressed withal, making a languishing sickness wait upon the triumph of passion, which the more it prevailed in her, the more it made her jealousy watchful both over her daughter and Zelmane, having ever one of them entrusted to her own eyes.
   But as soon as Basilius was rid of his wife’s presence, falling down on his knees, ‘O lady,' said he, ‘which hast only had the power to stir up again those flames which had so long lain dead in me, see in me the power of your beauty, which can make old age come to ask counsel of youth, and a prince unconquered to become a slave to a stranger. And when you see that power of yours, love that at least in me, since it is yours, although of me you see nothing to be loved.’
   ‘Worthy prince,’ answered Zelmane, taking him up from his kneeling ‘both your manner and your speech are so strange unto me as I know not how to answer it better than with silence.'
   
   
   If silence please you,' said the king, ‘it shall never displease me, since my heart is wholly pledged to obey you. Otherwise, if you would vouchsafe mine ears such happiness as to hear you, they shall convey your words to such a mind which is with the humblest degree of reverence to receive them.'
   ‘I disdain not to speak to you, mighty prince,' said Zelmane, ‘but I disdain to speak to any matter which may bring my honour into question.'
   And therewith, with a brave counterfeited scorn she departed from the king, leaving him not so sorry for his short answer as proud in himself that he had broken the matter. And thus did the king, feeding his mind with those thoughts, pass great time in writing verses and making more of himself than he was wont to do, that, with a little help, he would have grown into a pretty kind of dotage.
   But Zelmane, being rid of this loving but little loved company, ‘Alas,' said she, ‘poor Pyrocles, was there ever one but I that had received wrong and could blame nobody, that having more than I desire, am still in want of that I would? Truly, love, I must needs say thus much on thy behalf; thou hast employed my love there where all love is deserved, and for recompense hast sent me more love than ever I desired. But what wilt thou do, Pyrocles? Which way canst thou find to rid thee of thy intricate troubles? To her whom I would be known to, I five in darkness; and to her am revealed from whom I would be most secret. What shift shall I find against the diligent love of Basilius? What shield against the violent passions of Gynecia? And if that be done, yet how am I the nearer to quench the fire that consumes me? Well, well, sweet Philoclea, my whole confidence must be builded in thy divine spirit which cannot be ignorant of the cruel wound I have received by you.'
   CHAPTER 2
   But as sick folks when they are alone think company would relieve them, and yet having company, do find it noisome, changing willingly outward objects when indeed the evil is inward; so poor Zelmane was no more weary of Basilius than she was of herself when Basilius was gone; and ever the more, the more she turned her eyes to become her own judges. Tired wherewith, she longed to meet her friend Dorus that upon the shoulders of friendship she might lay the burden of sorrow; and therefore went toward the other lodge, where among certain beeches she found Dorus, apparelled in flannen, with a goat's-skin cast upon him and a garland of laurel mix’d with cypress leaves on his head, waiting on his master Dametas who at that time was teaching him how with his sheep-hook to catch a wanton lamb, and how with the same to cast a little clod at any one that strayed out of company. And while Dorus was practising, one might see Dametas holding his hand under his girdle behind him, nodding from the waist upwards, and swearing he never knew man go more awkwardly to work, and that they might talk of book-learning what they would but, for his part, he never saw more unfeatly fellows than great clerks were.
   But Zelmane’s coming saved Dorus from further chiding. And so she, beginning to speak with him of the number of his master’s sheep and which province of Arcadia bare the finest wool, drew him on to follow her in such country-discourses; till (being out of Dametas’ hearing) with such vehemency of passion as though her heart would climb into her mouth to take her tongue's office, she declared unto him upon what briars the roses of her affections grew; how time still seemed to forget her, bestowing no one hour of comfort upon her; she remaining still in one plight of ill fortune, saving so much worse as continuance of evil doth in itself increase evil. ‘Alas, my Dorus,’ said she, ‘thou seest how long and Ianguishingly the weeks are passed over us since our last talking. And yet am I the same, miserable I, that I was, only stronger in longing and weaker in hoping.’
   Then fell she to so pitiful a declaration of the insupportableness of her desires that Dorus’ ears, not able to show what wounds that discourse gave unto them, procured his eyes with tears to give testimony how much they suffered for her suffering; till passion (a most cumbersome guest to itself) made Zelmane, the sooner to shake it off, earnestly entreat Dorus that he also with like freedom of discourse would bestow a map of his little world upon her that she might see whether it were troubled with such unhabitable climes of cold despairs and hot rages as hers was.
   And so walking under a few palm-trees (which being loving in their own nature seemed to give their shadow the willinglier because they held discourse of love) Dorus thus entered to the description of his fortune.
   'Alas,' said he, ‘dear cousin, that it hath pleased the high powers to throw us to such an estate as the only intercourse of our true friendship must be a bartering of miseries. For my part, I must confess, indeed, that from a huge darkness of sorrows I am crept, I cannot say to a lightsomeness, but to a certain dawning, or rather peeping out of some possibility of comfort; but woe is me, so far from the mark of my desires that I rather think it such a light as comes through a small hole to a dungeon, that the miserable caitiff may the better remember the light of which he is deprived; or like a scholar who is only come to that degree of knowledge to find himself utterly ignorant But thus stands it with me. After that by your means I was exalted to serve in yonder blessed lodge, for a while I had in the furnace of my agonies this refreshing: that, because of the service I had done in killing of the bear, it pleased the princess (in whom indeed stateliness shines through courtesy) to let fall some gracious look upon me; sometimes to see my exercises, sometimes to hear my songs. For my part, my heart would not suffer me to omit any occasion whereby I might make the incomparable Pamela see how much extraordinary devotion I bare to her service, and withal strave to appear more worthy in her sight, that small desert joined to so great affection, might prevail something in the wisest lady. But too well, alas, I found that a shepherd’s service was but considered of as from a shepherd, and the acceptation limited to no further proportion than of a good servant And when my countenance had once given notice that there lay affection under it, I saw, straight, Majesty (sitting in the throne of beauty) draw forth such a sword of just disdain that I remained as a man thunderstricken, not daring - no not able - to behold that power.
   ‘Now to make my estate known seemed again impossible by reason of the suspiciousness of Dametas, Miso and my young mistress Mopsa. For Dametas (according to the constitution of a dull head) thinks no better way to show himself wise than by suspecting everything in his way: which suspicion Miso (for the hoggish shrewdness of her brain) and Mopsa (for a very unlikely envy she hath stumbled upon against the princess’ unspeakable beauty) were very glad to execute. So that I, finding my service by this means lightly regarded, my affection despised, and myself unknown, remained no fuller of desire than void of counsel how to come to my desire; which, alas, if these trees could speak, they might well witness. For many times have I stood here, bewailing myself unto them. Many times have I, leaning to yonder palm, admired the blessedness of it that it could bear love without sense of pain. Many times, when my master’s cattle came hither to chew their cud in this fresh place, I might see the young bull testify his love, but how? With proud looks and joyfulness.
   ‘ "O wretched mankind,” said I then to myself, “in whom wit, which should be the governor of his welfare, becomes the traitor to his blessedness! These beasts, like children to nature, inherit her blessings quietly: we, like bastards, are laid abroad, even as foundlings to be trained up by grief and sorrow. Their minds grudge not at their bodies’ comfort, nor their senses are letted from enjoying their objects: we have the impediments of honour and the torments of conscience.”
   ‘Truly in such cogitations have I sometimes so long stood that methought my feet began to grow into the ground, with such a darkness and heaviness of mind that I might easily have been persuaded to have resigned over my very essence. But love (which one time Iayeth burdens, another time giveth wings) when I was at the lowest of my downward thoughts, pulled up my heart to remember that nothing is achieved before it be throughly attempted, and that lying still doth never go forward; and that therefore it was time, now or never, to sharpen my invention to pierce through the hardness of this enterprise, never ceasing to assemble all my conceits one after the other how to manifest both my mind and estate. Till at last I lighted and resolved on this way, which yet perchance you will think was a way rather to hide it.
   ‘I began to counterfeit the extremest love towards Mopsa that might be; and as for the love, so lively it was indeed within me (although to another subject) that little I needed to counterfeit any notable demonstrations of it: and so making a contrariety the place of my memory, in her foulness I beheld Pamela’s fairness, still looking on Mopsa but thinking on Pamela, as if I saw my sun shine in a puddled water. I cried out of nothing but Mopsa: to Mopsa my attendance was directed: to Mopsa the best fruits I could gather were brought: to Mopsa it seemed still that mine eye conveyed my tongue. So that Mopsa was my saying; Mopsa was my singing; Mopsa (that is only suitable in laying a foul complexion upon a filthy favour, setting forth both in sluttishness) she was the lode-star of my life, she the blessing of mine eyes, she the overthrow of my desires, and yet the recompense of my overthrow; she the sweetness of my heart, even sweetening the death which her sweetness drew upon me. In sum, whatsoever I thought of Pamela, that I said of Mopsa; whereby as I gat my master’s goodwill (who before spited me, fearing lest I should win the princess’ favour from him) so did the same make the princess the better content to allow me her presence — whether indeed it were that a certain spark of noble indignation did rise in her not to suffer such a baggage to win away anything of hers, how meanly soever she reputed of it, or rather (as I think) my words being so passionate and shooting so quite contrary from the marks of Mopsa s worthiness, she perceived well enough whither they were directed; and therefore being so masked, she was contented as a sport of wit to attend them. Whereupon one day determining to find some means to tell, as of a third person, the tale of mine own love and estate, finding Mopsa (like a cuckoo by a nightingale) alone with Pamela, I came in unto them, and with a face, I am sure, full of cloudy fancies, took a harp and sung this song:
Since so mine eyes are subject to your sight,
       That in your sight they fixed have my brain;
Since so my heart is filled with that light,
       That only light doth all my life maintain;

Since in sweet you, all goods so richly reign,
       That where you are, no wished good can want;
Since so your living image lives in me,
       That in myself yourself true love doth plant;
       How can you him unworthy then decree,
       In whose chief part your worths implanted be?
   The song being ended, which I had often broken off in the midst with grievous sighs which overtook every verse I sang, I let fall my harp from me, and casting mine eyes sometimes upon Mopsa, but settling my sight principally upon Pamela, “And is it the only fortune, most beautiful Mopsa,” said I, “of wretched Dorus that Fortune must be the measure of his mind? Am I only he that because I am in misery, more misery must be laid upon me? Must that which should be cause of compassion become an argument of cruelty against me? Alas, excellent Mopsa, consider that a virtuous prince requires the life of his meanest subject, and the heavenly sun disdains not to give light to the smallest worm. O Mopsa, Mopsa, if my heart could be as manifest to you as it is uncomfortable to me, I doubt not the height of my thoughts should well countervail the lowness of my quality. Who hath not heard of the greatness of your estate? Who seeth not that your estate is much excelled with that sweet uniting of all beauties which remaineth and dwelleth with you? Who knows not that all these are but ornaments of that divine spark within you which, being descended from heaven, could not elsewhere pick out so sweet a mansion? But if you will know what is the band that ought to knit all these excellencies together, it is a kind mercifulness to such a one as is in his soul devoted to those perfections."
   ‘Mopsa, who already had had a certain smackering towards me, stood all this while with her hands sometimes before her face, but most commonly with a certain special grace of her own, wagging her lips, and grinning instead of smiling: but all the words I could get of her was (wrying her waist and thrusting out her chin) “In faith you jest with me. You are a merry man indeed."
   ‘But the ever pleasing Pamela (that well found the comedy would be marred if she did not help Mopsa to her part) was content to urge a little further of me. “Master Dorus,” said the fair Pamela, “methinks you blame your fortune very wrongfully, since the fault is not in Fortune but in you that cannot frame yourself to your fortune; and as wrongfully do require Mopsa to so great a disparagement as to her father’s servant, since she is not worthy to be loved that hath not some feeling of her own worthiness.”
   ‘I stayed a good while after her words, in hope she would have continued her speech, so great a delight I received in hearing her; but seeing her say no further, with a quaking all over my body I thus answered her: “Lady, most worthy of all duty, how falls it out that you, in whom all virtue shines, will take the patronage of Fortune, the only rebellious handmaid against virtue? Especially, since before your eyes you have a pitiful spectacle of her wickedness, a forlorn creature which must remain not such as I am but such as she makes me, since she must be the balance of worthiness or disparagement. Yet alas, if the condemned man, even at his death, have leave to speak, let my mortal wound purchase thus much consideration: since the perfections are such in the party I love as the feeling of them cannot come into any unnoble heart, shall that heart, which doth not only feel them but hath all the working of his life placed in them, shall that heart, I say, lifted up to such a height, be counted base? O let not an excellent spirit do itself such wrong as to think where it is placed, embraced and loved, there can be any unworthiness, since the weakest mist is not easlier driven away by the sun than that is chased away with so high thoughts.”
   ‘ “I will not deny,” answered the gracious Pamela, “but that the love you bear to Mopsa hath brought you to the consideration of her virtues, and that consideration may have made you the more virtuous and so the more worthy: but even that, then (you must confess) you have received of her, and so are rather gratefully to thank her than to press any further, till you bring something of your own whereby to claim it. And truly Dorus, I must in Mopsa’s behalf say thus much to you, that if her beauties have so overtaken you, it becomes a true love to have your heart more set upon her good than your own, and to bear a tenderer respect to her honour than your satisfaction.
   ‘ “Now by my hallidame, Madam,” said Mopsa, throwing a great number of sheep’s eyes upon me, “you have even touched mine own mind to the quick, forsooth.
   'I (finding that the policy that I had used had at least-wise procured thus much happiness unto me as that I might, even in my lady’s presence, discover the sore which had deeply festered within me, and that she could better conceive my reasons applied to Mopsa than she wouJd have vouchsafed them whilst herself was a party) thought good to pursue on my good beginning, using this fit occasion of Pamela’s wit and Mopsa’s ignorance. Therefore with an humble piercing eye, looking upon Pamela as if I had rather been condemned by her mouth than highly exalted by the other, turning myself to Mopsa, but keeping mine eye where it was:
   ‘ “Fair Mopsa,” said I, "well do I find by the wise knitting together of your answer that any disputation I can use is as much too weak as I unworthy, I find my love shall be proved no love, without I leave to love, being too unfit a vessel in whom so high thoughts should be engraved. Yet since the love I bear you hath so joined itself to the best part of my life as the one cannot depart but that the other will follow, before I seek to obey you in making my last passage, let me know which is my unworthiness, either of mind, estate, or both?”
   'Mopsa was about to say in neither; for her heart I think tumbled with overmuch kindness, when Pamela, with a more favourable countenance than before, finding how apt I was to fall into despair, told me I might therein have answered myself; for besides that it was granted me that the inward feeling of Mopsa’s perfections had greatly beautified my mind, there was none could, deny but that my mind and body deserved great allowance. “But Dorus,” said she, “you must be so far master of your love as to consider that since the judgement of the world stands upon matter of fortune, and that the sex of womankind of all other is most bound to have regardful eye to men's judgements, it is not for us to play the philosophers in seeking out your hidden virtues, since that which in a wise prince would be counted wisdom, in us will be taken for a light grounded affection: so is not one thing one, done by divers persons.”
   ‘There is no man in a burning fever feels so great contentment in cold water greedily received (which as soon as the drink ceaseth, the rage reneweth) as poor I found my soul refreshed with her sweetly pronounced words, and newly and more violently again inflamed as soon as she had closed up her delightful speech with no less well graced silence. But remembering in myself that as well the soldier dieth which standeth still as he that gives the bravest onset, and seeing that to the making up of my fortune there wanted nothing so much as the making known of mine estate, with a face well witnessing how deeply my soul was possessed, and with the most submissive behaviour that a thralled heart could express, even as my words had been too thick for my mouth, at length spoke to this purpose:
   ‘ "Alas, most worthy Princess,” said I, “and do not then your own sweet words sufficiently testify that there was never man could have a juster action against filthy fortune than I, since all other things being granted me, her blindness is my only let? O heavenly God, I would either she had such eyes as were able to discern my deserts, or I were blind not to see the daily cause of my misfortune. But yet,” said I, “most honoured lady, if my miserable speeches have not already cloyed you, and that the very presence of such a wretch become not hateful in your eyes, let me reply thus much further against my mortal sentence by telling you a story which happened in this same country long since — for woes make the shortest time seem long - whereby you shall see that my estate is not so contemptible but that a prince hath been content to take the like upon him, and by that only hath aspired to enjoy a mighty princess.” Pamela graciously harkened, and I told my tale in this sort.
   CHAPTER 3
   ‘"In the country of Thessalia (alas, why name I that accursed country which brings forth nothing but matters for tragedies - but name it I must!) in Thessalia, I say, there was (well may I say there was) a prince (No, no prince, whom bondage wholly possessed) but yet accounted a prince, and named Musidorus. O Musidorus, Musidorus! But to what serve exclamations, where there are no ears to receive the sound? This Musidorus being yet in the tenderest age, his worthy father paid to nature, with a violent death, her last duties, leaving his child to the faith of his friends and the proof of time. Death gave him not such pangs as the foresightful care he had of his silly successor. And yet if in his foresight he could have seen so much, happy was that good prince in his timely departure which barred him from the knowledge of his son’s miseries, which his knowledge could neither have prevented nor relieved. The young Musidorus (being thus, as for the first pledge of the destinies’ goodwill, deprived of his principal stay) was yet for some years after, as if the stars would breathe themselves for a greater mischief, lulled up in as much good luck as the heedful love of his doleful mother and the flourishing estate of his country could breed unto him.
   ‘ “But when the time nowcame that misery seemed to be ripe for him, because he had age to know misery, I think there was a conspiracy in all heavenly and earthly things to frame fit occasions to lead him unto it. His people (to whom all foreign matters in foretime were odious) began to wish in their beloved prince experience by travel: his dear mother, whose eyes were held open only with the joy of looking upon him, did now dispense with the comfort of her widowed life, desiring the same her subjects did, for the increase of her son’s worthiness.
   "And hereto did Musidorus’ own virtue (see how virtue can be a minister to mischief) sufficiently provoke him; for indeed thus much I must say for him (although the likeness of our mishaps makes me presume to pattern myself unto him) that well-doing was at that time his scope, from which no faint pleasure could withhold him. But the present occasion which did knit all this together was his uncle the king of Macedon who, having lately before gotten such victories as were beyond expectation, did at this time send both for the prince his son (brought up together, to avoid the wars, with Musidorus) and for Musidorus himself, that his joy might be the more full, having such partakers of it But alas, to what a sea of miseries my plaintful tongue doth lead me!” - and thus out of breath rather with that I thought than that I  said, I stayed my speech, till Pamela showing by countenance that such was her pleasure, I thus continued it:
    “These two young princes, to satisfy the king, took their way by sea towards Thrace, whither they would needs go with a navy to succour him, he being at that time before Bizantium with a mighty army besieging it, where at that time his court was. But when the conspired heavens had gotten this subject of their wrath upon so fit a place as the sea was, they straight began to breathe out in boisterous winds some part of their malice against him, so that with the loss of all his navy, he only with the prince his cousin were cast a-land far off from the place whither their desires would have guided them. O cruel winds, in your unconsiderate rages why either began you this fury, or why did you not end it in his end? But your cruelty was such, as you would spare his life for many deathful torments. To tell you what pitiful mishaps fell to the young prince of Macedon, his cousin, I should too much fill your ears with strange horrors; neither will I stay upon those laboursome adventures nor loathsome misadventures to which, and through which, his fortune and courage conducted him. My speech hasteneth itself to come to the full point of Musidorus infortunes. For as we find the most pestilent diseases do gather into themselves all the infirmities with which the body before was annoyed, so did his last misery embrace in the extremity of itself all his former mischiefs.
    “Arcadia, Arcadia was the place prepared to be the stage of his endless overthrow. Arcadia was (alas, well might I say, it is) the charmed circle where all his spirits for ever should be enchanted. For here, and nowhere else, did his infected eyes make his mind know what power heavenly beauty hath to throw it down to hellish agonies. Here, here did he see the Arcadian king s eldest daughter, in whom he forthwith placed so all his hopes of joy and joyful parts of his heart that he left in himself nothing but a maze of longing and a dungeon of sorrow. But alas, what can saying make them believe whom seeing cannot persuade? Those pains must be felt before they can be understood: no outward utterance can command a conceit. Such was as then the state of the king as it was no time by direct means to seek her. And such was the state of his captivated will as he could delay no time of seeking her.
   ‘ “In this entangled case, he clothed himself in a shepherd’s weed, that under the baseness of that form he might at least have free access to feed his eyes with that which should at length eat up his heart. In which doing, thus much without doubt he hath manifested that this estate is not always to be rejected, since under that veil there may be hidden things to be esteemed. And if he might with taking on a shepherd’s look cast up his eyes to the fairest princess Nature in that time created, the like, nay the same desire of mine need no more to be disdained or held for disgraceful. But now, alas, mine eyes wax dim, my tongue begins to falter and my heart to want force to help either, with the feeling remembrance I have in what heap of miseries the caitiff prince lay at this time buried. Pardon, therefore, most excellent princess, if I cut off the course of my dolorous tale, since, if I be understood, I have said enough for the defence of my baseness; and for that which after might befall to that pattern of ill fortune, the matters are too monstrous for my capacity: his hateful destinies must best declare their own workmanship.”
   ‘Thus having delivered my tale in this perplexed manner, to the end the princess might judge that he meant himself who spake so feelingly, her answer was both strange and in some respect comfortable. For would you think it? She hath heard heretofore of us both by means of the valiant prince Plangus, and particularly of our casting away, which she (following my own style) thus delicately brought forth:
   ' "You have told,” said she, "Dorus, a pretty tale, but you are much deceived in the latter end of it For the Prince Musidorus with his cousin Pyrocles did both perish upon the coast of Laconia, as a noble gentleman called Plangus, who was well acquainted with the history, did assure my father.”
   ‘O how that speech of hers did pour joys in my heart! O blessed name (thought I) of mine, since thou hast been in that tongue, and passed through those lips, though I can never hope to approach them.
   ‘ "As for Pyrocles,” said I, "I will not deny it but that he is perished,” - (which I said lest sooner suspicion might arise of your being here than yourself would have it and yet affirmed no lie unto her, since I only said I would not deny it) - "But for Musidorus,” said I, “I perceive indeed you have neither heard or read the story of that unhappy prince; for this was the very objection which that peerless princess did make unto him when he sought to appear such as he was before her wisdom: and thus, as I have read it fair written, in the certainty of my knowledge he might answer her: that indeed the ship wherein he came by a treason was perished, and therefore that Plangus might easily be deceived; but that he himself was cast upon the coast of Laconia, where he was taken up by a couple of shepherds, who lived in those days famous for that both loving one fair maid, they yet remained constant friends - one of whose songs not long since was sung before you by the shepherd Lamon - and brought by them to a nobleman’s house near Mantinea, whose son had, a little before his marriage, been taken prisoner, and by the help of this prince Musidorus (though naming himself by another name) was delivered.”
   ‘Now these circumlocutions I did use, because of the one side I knew the princess would know well the parties I meant, and of the other, if I should have named Strephon, Claius, Kalander and Cli- tophon, perhaps it would have rubb'd some conjecture into the heavy head of mistress Mopsa.
   "And therefore,”said I, "most divine lady, he justly was thus to argue against such suspicions, that the prince might easily by those parties be satisfied that upon that wreck such a one was taken up, and therefore that Plangus might well err, who knew not of any's taking up again: that he that was so preserved brought good tokens to be one of the two chief of that wrecked company; which two, since Plangus knew to be Musidorus and Pyrocles, he must needs be one of them, although, as I said, upon a fore-taken vow he was otherwise at that time called. Besides, the princess must needs judge that no less than a prince durst un er- take such an enterprise, which, though he might get the favour of the princess, he could never defend with less than a prince s power against the force of Arcadia. Lastly, said he, for a certain demonstration, he presumed to show unto the princess a mark he had on his face, as I might,” said I, "show this of my neck to the rare Mopsa,' - and, withal, showed my neck to them both, where, as you know, there is a red spot bearing figure, as they tell me, of a lion's paw - “that she may ascertain herself that I am Menalcas' brother. And so did he, beseeching her to send someone she might trust into Thessalia, secretly to be advertised whether the age, the complexion, and particularly that notable sign did not fully agree with their prince Musidorus.”
   ‘ “Do you not know further,” said she (with a settled countenance not accusing any kind of inward motion) “of that story?”
   “Alas, no,” said I, “for even here the historiographer stopped, saying the rest belonged to astrology.”
   ‘And therewith, thinking her silent imaginations began to work upon somewhat, to mollify them (as the nature of music is to do) and, withal, to show what kind of shepherd I was, took up my harp and sang these few verses:
My sheep are thoughts, which I both guide and serve,
       Their pasture is fair hills of fruitless love:
On barren sweets they feed, and feeding starve:
       I wail their lot, but will not other prove.
My sheep-hook is wan hope, which all upholds:
       My weeds, desire, cut out in endless folds.
       What wool my sheep shall bear, whiles thus they live,
       In you it is, you must the judgement give.
   ‘And then, partly to bring Mopsa again to the matter lest she should too much take heed to our discourses, but principally, if it were possible, to gather some comfort out of her answers, I kneeled down to the princess and humbly besought her to move Mopsa in my behalf that she would unarm her noble heart of that steely resistance against the sweet blows of love: that since all her parts were decked with some particular ornament - her face with beauty, her head with wisdom, her eyes with majesty, her countenance with gracefulness, her lips with loveliness, her tongue with victory - that she would make her heart the throne of pity, being the most excellent raiment of the most excellent part.
   ‘Pamela, without show either of favour or disdain, either of heeding or neglecting what I had said, turned her speech to Mopsa, and with such a voice and action as might show she spake of a matter which little did concern her, “Take heed to yourself,” said she, “Mopsa, for your shepherd can speak well: but truly, if he do fully prove himself such as he saith, I mean, the honest shepherd Menalcas’ brother and heir, I know no reason why you should think scorn of him."
   ‘Mopsa, though in my conscience she were even then far spent towards me, yet she answered her that for all my quaint speeches she would keep her honesty close enough; and that as for the way of matrimony, she would step never a foot further till my master, her father, had spoken the whole word himself, no she would not. But ever and anon turning her muzzle towards me, she threw such a prospect upon me as might well have given a surfeit to any weak lover’s stomach. But, lord, what a fool am I to mingle that drivel’s speeches among my noble thoughts — but because she was an actor in this tragedy, to give you a full knowledge and to leave nothing that I can remember unrepeated.
   ‘Now the princess being about to withdraw herself from us, I took a jewel made in the figure of a crab-fish, which, because it looks one way and goes another, I thought it did fitly pattern out my looking to Mopsa but bending to Pamela. The word about it was, “By force, not choice"; and still kneeling, besought the princess that she would vouchsafe to give it Mopsa, and with the blessedness of her hand to make acceptable unto her that toy which I had found, following of late an acquaintance of mine at the plough. “For,” said I, “as the earth was turned up, the ploughshare lighted upon a great stone. We pull’d that up, and so foun both that and some other pretty things which we had divided betwixt us.”	
   ‘Mopsa was benumbed with joy when the princess gave it her; but in the princess I could find no apprehension of what I either said or did, but with a calm carelessness letting each thing slide justly, as we do by their speeches who neither in matter nor person do anyway belong unto us; which kind of cold temper, mix'd with that lightning of her natural majesty, is of all others most terrible unto me: for yet if I found she contemned me, I would desperately labour both in fortune aud virtue to overcome it: if she only misdoubted me I were in heaven, for quickly I would bring sufficient assurance: lastly, if she hated me, yet I should know what passion to deal with, and either with infiniteness of desert I would take away the fuel from that fire, or if nothing would serve, then I would give her my heart-blood to quench it. But this cruel quietness, neither retiring to mislike nor proceeding to favour; gracious, but gracious still after one manner; all her courtesies having this engraven in them, that what is done is for virtue’s sake, not for the party’s; ever keeping her course like the sun who neither for our praises nor curses will spur or stop his horses: this, I say, heavenliness of hers (for howsoever my misery is, I cannot but so entitle it) is so impossible to reach unto that I almost begin to submit myself to the tyranny of despair, not knowing any way of persuasion where wisdom seems to be un- sensible.I have appeared to her eyes like myself, by a device I used with my master, persuading him that we two might put on certain rich apparel I had provided, and so practise something on horseback before Pamela, telling him it was apparel I had gotten for playing well the part of a king in a tragedy at Athens. My horse indeed was it I had left at Menalcas’ house, and Dametas got one by friendship out of the prince’s stable. But howsoever I show I am no base body, all I do is but to beat a rock and get foam.’
   CHAPTER 4
   But as Dorus was about to tell further, Dametas (who came whistling, and counting upon his fingers how many load of hay his seventeen fat oxen eat up in a year) desired Zelmane from the king that she would come into the lodge where they stayed for her.
   ‘Alas,’ said Dorus, taking his leave, ‘the sum is this, that you may well find you have beaten your sorrow against such a wall which, with the force of rebound, may well make your sorrow stronger.’ But Zelmane turning her speech to Dametas, 'I shall grow,’ said she, ‘skilful in country matters if I have often conference with your servant.’
   In sooth,’ answered Dametas with a graceless scorn, ‘the lad may prove well enough, if he oversoon think not too well of himself, and will bear away that he heareth of his elders.’
   And therewith as they walked to the other lodge, to make Zelmane find she might have spent her time better with him he began With a wild method to run over all the art of husbandry, especially employing his tongue about well dunging of a field, while poor Zelmane yielded her ears to those tedious strokes, not warding them so much as with any one answer, till they came to Basilius and Gynecia, who attended for her in a coach to carry her abroad to see some sports prepared for her.
   Basilius and Gynecia, sitting in the one end, placed her at the other, with her left side to Philoclea. Zelmane was moved in her mind to have kissed their feet for the favour of so blessed a seat, for the narrowness of the coach made them join from the foot to the shoulders very close together; the truer touch whereof though it were barred by their envious apparel, yet as a perfect magnes though put in an ivory box will through the box send forth his embracing virtue to a beloved needle, so this imparadised neighbourhood made Zelmane’s soul cleave unto her both through the ivory case of her body and the apparel which did overcloud it all the blood of Zelmane’s body stirring in her, as wine will do when sugar is hastily put into it seeking to suck the sweetness of the beloved guest; her heart like a lion new imprisoned, seeing him that restrains his liberty before the grate, not panting but striving violently (if it had been possible) to have leaped into the lap of Philoclea.
   But Dametas, even then proceeding from being master of a cart to be doctor of a coach, not a little proud in himself that his whip at that time guided the rule of Arcadia, drave the coach, the cover whereof was made with such joints that as they might (to avoid the weather) pull it up close when they listed, so when they would they might put each end down and remain as discovered and open-sighted as on horseback: till upon the side of the forest they had both greyhounds, spaniels and hounds, whereof the first might seem the lords, the second the gentlemen, and the last the yeomen of dogs. A cast of merlins there was besides, which, flying of a gallant height over certain bushes, would beat the birds that rose down into the bushes, as falcons will do wild-fowl over a river.
   But the sport which for that day Basilius would principally show to Zelmane was the mounty at a hern; which, getting up on his waggling wings with pain till he was come to some height (as though the air next to the earth were not fit for his great body to fly through) was now grown to diminish the sight of himself, and to give example to great persons that the higher they be, the less they should show; when a jerfaulcon was cast off after her, who straight spying where the prey was, fixing her eye with desire and guiding her wing by her eye, used no more strength than industry. For as a good builder to a high tower will not make his stair upright but winding almost the full compass about, that the steepness be the more unsensible; so she, seeing the towering of her pursued chase, went circling and compassing about, rising so with the less sense of rising: and yet finding that way scantly serve the greediness of her haste, as an ambitious body will go far out of the direct way to win to a point of height which he desires, so would she, as it were, turn tail to the heron and fly quite out another way; but all was to return in a higher pitch, which once gotten, she would either beat with cruel assaults the heron (who now was driven to the best defence of force since flight would not serve) or else clasping with him, come down together, to be parted by the over-partial beholders.
   Divers of which flights Basilius showing to Zelmane, thus was the riches of the time spent and the day deceased before it was thought of, till night like a degenerating successor made his departure the better remembered. And therefore, so constrained, they willed Dametas to drive homeward, who (half sleeping, half musing about the mending of a wine-press) guided the horses so ill that the wheel coming over a great stub of a tree, it overturned the coach; which though it fell violently upon the side where Zelmane and Gynecia sat, yet for Zelmane’s part, she would have been glad of the fall which made her bear the sweet burden of Philoclea, but that she feared she might receive some hurt. But indeed neither she did, nor any of the rest, by reason they kept their arms and legs within the coach, saving Gynecia who with the only bruise of the fall had her shoulder put out of joint; which, though by one of the falconer's cunning it was set well again, yet with much pain was she brought to the lodge; and pain (fetching his ordinary companion, a fever, with him) drave her to entertain them both in her bed.
   But neither was the fever of such impatient heat as the inward plague-sore of her .affection, nor the pain half so noisome as the jealousy she conceived of her daughter Philoclea, lest this time of her sickness might give apt occasion to Zelmane, whom she misdoubted. Therefore she called Philoclea to her, and though it were late in the night, commanded her in her ear to go to the other lodge and send Miso to her, with whom she would speak, and she to lie with her sister Pamela. The meanwhile Gynecia kept Zelmane with her because she would be sure she should be out of the lodge before she licensed Zelmane. Philoclea, not skill'd in any thing better than obedience, went quietly down; and the moon then full (not thinking scorn to be a torch-bearer to such beauty) guided her steps whose motions bare a mind which bare in itself far more stirring motions. And alas, sweet Philoclea, how hath my pen till now forgot thy passions, since to thy memory principally all this long matter is intended! Pardon the slackness to come to those woes which, having caused in others, thou didst feel in thyself.
   The sweet minded Philoclea was in their degree of well-doing to whom the not knowing of evil serveth for a ground of virtue, and hold their inward powers in better form with an unspotted simplicity than many who rather cunningly seek to know what goodness is than willingly take into themselves the following of it But as that sweet and simple breath of heavenly goodness is the easier to be altered because it hath not passed through the worldly wickedness nor feelingly found the evil that evil carries with it, so now the lady Philoclea (whose eyes and senses had received nothing but according as the natural course of each thing required, whose tender youth had obediently lived under her parents' behests, without framing out of her own will the forechoosing of any thing) when now she came to appoint wherein her judgement was to be practised in knowing faultiness by his first tokens, she was like a young fawn who, coming in the wind of the hunters, doth not know whether it be a thing or no to be eschewed; whereof at this time she began to get a costly experience.
   For after that Zelmane had a while lived in the lodge with her and that her only being a noble stranger had bred a kind of heedful attention; her coming to that lonely place where she had nobody but her parents, a willingness of conversation, her wit and behaviour, a liking and silent admiration, at length the excellency of her natural gifts joined with the extreme shows she made of most devout honouring Philoclea (carrying thus, in one person, the only two bands of goodwill, loveliness and lovingness) brought forth in her heart a yielding to a most friendly affection; which when it had gotten so full possession of the keys of her mind that it would receive no message from her senses without that affection were the interpreter, then straight grew an exceeding delight still to be with her, with an unmeasurable liking of all that Zelmane did; matters being so turned in her that where at first, liking her manners did breed goodwill, now goodwill became the chief cause of liking her manners, so that within a while Zelmane was not prized for her demeanour but the demeanour was prized because it was Zelmane's.
   Then followed that most natural effect of conforming herself to that which she did like, and not only wishing to be herself such another in all things, but to ground an imitation upon so much an esteemed authority; so that the next degree was to mark all Zelmane's doings, speeches, and fashions, and to take them into herself as a pattern of worthy proceeding. Which when once it was enacted not only by the commonalty of passions but agreed unto by her most noble thoughts, and that reason itself (not yet experienced in the issues of such matters) had granted his royal assent, then friendship, a diligent officer, took care to see the statute thoroughly observed Then grew on that not only she did imitate the soberness of her countenance, the gracefulness of her speech, but even their particular gestures; so that as Zelmane did often eye her, she would often eye Zelmane; and as Zelmane's eyes would deliver a submissive but vehement desire in their look, she, though as yet she had not the desire in her, yet should her eyes answer in like piercing kindness of a look. Zelmane, as much as Gynecia’s jealousy would suffer, desired to be near Philoclea; Philoclea, as much as Gynetia's jealousy would suffer, desired to be near Zelmane. If Zelmane took her hand and sofdy strained it, she also, thinking the knots of friendship ought to be mutual, would with a sweet fastness show she was loth to part from it. And if Zelmane sighed, she should sigh also; when Zelmane was sad, she deemed it wisdom and therefore she would be sad too. Zelmane’s languishing countenance, with crossed arms and sometimes cast up eyes, she thought to have an excellent grace, and therefore she also willingly put on the same countenance, till at the last, poor soul, ere she were aware, she accepted not only the badge but the service, not only the sign but the passion signified.
   For whether it were that her wit in continuance did find that Zelmane's friendship was full of impatient desire having more than ordinary limits, and therefore she was content to second Zelmane though herself knew not the limits, or that in truth true love, well considered, have an infective power, at last she fell in acquaintance with love’s harbinger, wishing. First she would wish that they two might live all their lives together, like two of Diana's nymphs. But that wish she thought not sufficient, because she knew there would be more nymphs besides them who also would have their part in Zelmane. Then would she wish that she were her sister, that such a natural band might make her more special to her. But against that, she considered that, though bang her sister, if she happened to be married she should be robbed of her. Then grown bolder, she would wish either herself or Zelmane a man, that there might succeed a blessed marriage betwixt them. But when that wish had once displayed his ensign in her mind, then followed whole squadrons of longings that so it might be, with a main battle of mislikings and repinings against their creation, that so it was not. Then dreams by night began to bring more unto her than she durst wish by day, whereout waking did make her know herself the better by the image of those fancies. But as some diseases, when they are easy to be cured they are hard to be known, but when they grow easy to be known they are almost impossible to be cured, so the sweet Philoclea, while she might prevent it, she did not feel it; now she felt it when it was past preventing, like a river, no rampires being built against it till already it have overflowed. For now indeed love pulled off his mask and showed his face unto her, and told her plainly that she was his prisoner. Then needed she no more paint her face with passions, for passions shone through her face: then her rosy colour was often increased with extraordinary blushing, and so another time, perfect whiteness descended to a degree of paleness; now hot, then cold, desiring she knew not what, nor how, if she knew what.
   Then her mind (though too late) by the smart was brought to think of the disease, and her own proof taught her to know her mother’s mind, which (as no error gives so strong assault as that which comes armed in the authority of a parent) so greatly fortified her desires to see that her mother had the like desires. And the more jealous her mother was, the more she thought the jewel precious which was with so many locks guarded. But that prevailing so far as to keep the two lovers from private conference, then began she to feel the sweetness of a lover’s solitariness when freely with words and gestures, as if Zelmane were present, she might give passage to her thoughts and so, as it were, utter out some smoke of those flames wherewith else she was not only burned but smothered: as this night, that going from the one lodge to the other by her mother’s commandment, with doleful gestures and uncertain paces, she did willingly accept the time s offer to be a while alone; so that going a little aside into the wood where many times before she had delighted to walk, her eyes were saluted with a tuft of trees so close set together as, with the shade the moon gave through it, it might breed a fearful kind of devotion to look upon it. But true thoughts of love banished all vain fancy of superstition. Full well she did both remember and like the place, for there had she often with their shade beguiled Phoebus of looking upon her: there had she enjoyed herself often, while she Was mistress of herself and had no other thoughts but such as might arise out of quiet senses.
   But the principal cause that invited her remembrance was a goodly white marble stone that should seem had been dedicated in ancient time to the Sylvan gods; which she finding there a few days before Zelmane’s coming, had written these words upon it as a testimony of her mind against the suspicion her captivity made her think she lived in. The writing was this:
You living powers enclos’d in stately shrine 
       Of growing trees; you rural Gods that wield 
Your sceptres here, if to your ears divine
       A voice may come, which troubled soul doth yield;
       This vow receive, this vow, O Gods, maintain;
       My virgin life no spotted thought shall stain.

Thou purest stone, whose pureness doth present 
       My purest mind; whose temper hard doth show 
My temper’d heart; by thee my promise sent 
       Unto myself let after-livers know.
       No fancy mine, nor others’ wrong suspect 
       Make me, O virtuous shame, thy laws neglect.

O Chastity, the chief of heavenly lights,
       Which mak’st us most immortal shape to wear,
Hold thou my heart, establish thou my sprites:
       To only thee my constant course I bear.
       ’Till spotless soul unto thy bosom fly,
       Such life to lead, such death I vow to die.
   But now that her memory served as an accuser of her change and that her own handwriting was there to bear testimony against her fall, she went in among those few trees, so closed in the tops together as they might seem a little chapel; and there might she, by the help of the moon-light,  perceive the good stone which served as an altar in that woody devotion. But neither the light was enough to read the words, and the ink was already forworn and in many places blotted, which as she perceived, ‘Alas! said she, ‘fair marble, which never received’st spot but by my writing, well do these blots become a blotted writer. But pardon her which did not dissemble then, although she have changed since. Enjoy, enjoy the glory of thy nature which can so constantly bear the marks of my inconstancy.’ And herewith, hiding her eyes with her soft hand, there came into her head certain verses which, if she had had present commodity, she would have adjoined as a retractation to the other. They were to this effect.
My words, in hope to blaze my steadfast mind,
       This marble chose, as of like temper known:
But lo, my words defac’d, my fancies blind,
       Blots to the stone, shames to myself I find:
       And witness am, how ill agree in one 
       A woman’s hand with constant marble stone.

My words full weak, the marble full of might:
       My words in store, the marble all alone;
My words black ink, the marble kindly white;
       My words unseen, the marble still in sight,
       May witness bear how ill agree in one 
       A woman’s hand with constant marble stone.
   But seeing she could not see means to join as then this recantation to the former vow, laying all her fair length under one of the trees, for a while she did nothing but turn up and down, as if she had hoped to turn away the fancy that mastered her, and hid her face, as if she could have hidden herself from her own fancies.
   At length with a whispering note to herself: ‘O me unfortunate wretch,’ said she, ‘what poisonous heats be these which thus torment me? How hath the sight of this strange guest invaded my soul? Alas, what entrance found this desire, or what strength had it thus to conquer me?’ Then a cloud passing between her sight and the moon, ‘O Diana,’ said she, ‘I would either the cloud that now hides the light of my virtue would as easily pass away as you will quickly overcome this let, or else that you were for ever thus darkened to serve for an excuse of my outrageous folly.’
   Then looking to the stars, which had perfectly as then beautified the clear sky: 'My parents/ said she, ‘have told me that in these fair heavenly bodies there are great hidden deities which have their working in the ebbing and flowing of our estates. If it be so, then, O you stars, judge rightly of me, and if I have with wicked intent made myself a prey to fancy, or if by any idle lusts I framed my heart fit for such an impression, then let this plague daily increase in me till my name be made odious to womankind. But if extreme and unresictable violence have oppressed me, who will ever do any of you sacrifice, O you stars, if you do not succour me? No, no, you will not help me. No, no, you cannot help me: sin must be the mother and shame the daughter of my affection. And yet are these but childish objections, simple Philoclea; it is the impossibility that doth torment me: for unlawful desires are punished after the effect of enjoying, but impossible desires are punished in the desire itself. O then, O ten times unhappy that I am, since where in all other hope kindleth love, in me despair should be the bellows of my affection; and of all despairs the most miserable which is drawn from impossibility. The most covetous man longs not to get riches out of a ground which never can bear anything. Why? Because it is impossible. The most ambitious wight vexeth not his wits to climb into heaven. Why? Because it is impossible. Alas, then, O love, why dost thou in thy beautiful sampler set such a work for my desire to take out, which is as much impossible?
   'And yet alas, why do I thus condemn my fortune before I hear what she can say for herself? What do I, silly wench, know what love hath prepared for me? Do I not see my mother as well, at least as furiously as myself, love Zelmane, and should I be wiser than my mother? Either she sees a possibility in that which I think impossible, or else impossible loves need not misbecome me. And do I not see Zelmane (who doth not think a thought which is not first weighed by wisdom and virtue) doth not she vouchsafe to love me with like ardour? I see it; her eyes depose it to be true. What then? And if she can love poor me, shall I think scorn to love such a woman as Zelmane? Away then all vain examinations of why and how. Thou lovest me, excellent Zelmane, and I love thee.’ And with that, embracing the very ground whereon she lay, she said to herself (for even to herself she was ashamed to speak it out in words) ‘O my Zelmane, govern and direct me, for I am wholly given over unto thee.’
   CHAPTER 5
   In this depth of muses and divers sorts of discourses would she ravingly have remained but that Dametas and Miso (who were round about to seek her, understanding she was to come to their lodge that night) came hard by her; Dametas saying that he would not deal in other body’s matters, but for his part he did not like that maids should once stir out of their father’s houses but if it were to milk a cow or save a chicken from a kite’s foot or some such other matter of importance; and Miso swearing that if it were her daughter Mopsa, she would give her a lesson for walking so late that should make her keep within doors for one fortnight.-But their jangling made Philoclea rise, and pretending as though she had done it but to sport with them, went with them (after she had willed Miso to wait upon her mother) to the lodge; where, being now accustomed (by her parents’ discipline) as well as her sister to serve herself, she went alone up to Pamela’s chamber: where, meaning to delight her eyes and joy her thoughts with the sweet conversation of her beloved sister, she found her (though it were in the time that the wings of night doth blow sleep most willingly into mortal creatures) sitting in a chair, lying backward, with her head almost over the back of it, and looking upon a wax candle which burnt before her; in one hand holding a letter, in the other her handkerchief which had lately drunk up the tears of her eyes, leaving instead of them crimson circles, like red flakes in the element when the weather is hottest Which Philoclea finding (for her eyes had learned to know the badges of sorrow) she earnestly entreated to know the cause thereof, that either she might comfort or accompany her doleful humour. But Pamela, rather seeming sorry that she had perceived so much than willing to open any further:
   O my Pamela,’ said Philoclea, ‘who are to me a sister in nature, a mother in counsel, a princess by the law of our country, and (which name methinks of all other is the dearest) a friend by my choice and your favour, what means this banishing me from your counsels? Do you love your sorrow so well as to grudge me part of it? Or do you think I shall not love a sad Pamela so well as a joyful? Or be my ears unworthy, or my tongue suspected? What is it, my sister, that you should conceal from your sister, yea and servant Philoclea?’
   These words won no further of Pamela but that telling her they might talk better as they lay together, they impoverished their clothes to enrich their bed which for that night might well scorn the shrine of Venus: and there, cherishing one another with dear though chaste embracements, with sweet though cold kisses, it might seem that love was come to play him there without dart, or that, weary of his own fires, he was there to refresh himself between their sweet breathing lips.
   But Philoclea earnestly again entreated Pamela to open her grief; who, drawing the curtain that the candle might not complain of her blushing, was ready to speak, but the breath, almost formed into words, was again stopped by her and turned into sighs. But at last, ‘I pray you,’ said she, ‘sweet Philoclea, let us talk of some other thing: and tell me whether you did ever see anything so amended as our pastoral sports be since that Dorus came hither?’
   O love, how far thou seest with blind eyes! Philoclea had straight found her, and therefore to draw out more, Indeed, said she, ‘I have often wondered to myself how such excellencies could be in so mean a person; but belike Fortune was afraid to lay her treasures where they should be stained with so many perfections: only I marvel how he can frame himself to hide so rare gifts under such a block as Dametas.’
   ‘Ah! said Pamela, ‘if you knew the cause: but no more do I neither; and to say the truth - but Lord, how are we fallen to talk of this fellowl And yet indeed if you were sometimes with me to mark him while Dametas reads his rustic lecture unto him how to feed his beasts before noon, where to shade them in the extreme heat, how to make the manger handsome for his oxen, when to use the goad and when the voice, giving him rules of a herdman though he pretend to make him a shepherd - to see all the while with what a grace (which seems to set a crown upon his base estate) he can descend to those poor matters, certainly you would - but to what serves this? No doubt we were better sleep than talk of these idle matters.’
   ‘Ah my Pamela,’ said Philoclea, ‘I have caught you. The constancy of your wit was not wont to bring forth such disjointed speeches. You love. Dissemble no further.’
   ‘It is true,’ said Pamela, ‘now you have it; and with less ado should, if my heart could have thought those words suitable for my mouth. But indeed, my Philoclea, take heed, for I think virtue itself is no armour of proof against affection. Therefore learn by my example.'
   ‘Alas,’ thought Philoclea to herself, 'your shears come too late to clip the bird's wings that already is flown away.’ But then Pamela, being once set in the stream of her love, went away amain, withal telling her how his noble qualities had drawn her liking towards him, but yet ever weighing his meanness, and so held continually in due limits; till seeking many means to speak with her, and ever kept from it (as well because she shunn’d it, seeing and disdaining his mind, as because of her jealous jailors) he had at length used the finest policy that might be in counterfeiting love to Mopsa, and saying to Mopsa whatsoever he would have her know: and in how passionate manner he had told his own tale in a third person, making poor Mopsa believe that it was a matter fallen out many ages before.
   ‘And in the end, because you shall know my tears come not neither of repentance nor misery, who, think you, is my Dorus fallen out to be? Even the Prince Musidorus, famous over all Asia for his heroical enterprises, of whom you remember how much good the stranger Plangus told my father; he not being drowned, as Plangus thought, though his cousin Pyrocles indeed perished. Ah my sister, if you had heard his words or seen his gestures when he made me know what and to whom his love was, you would have matched in yourself those two rarely matched together, pity and delight. Tell me, dear sister - for the gods are my witnesses I desire to do virtuously - can I without the detestable stain of ungratefulness abstain from loving him who-(far exceeding the beautifulness of his shape with the beautifulness of his mind, and the greatness of his estate with the greatness of his acts) is content so to abase himself as to become Dametas’ servant for my sake? You will say, but how know I him to be Musidorus, since the handmaid of wisdom is slow of belief? That consideration did not want in me, for the nature of desire itself is no easier to receive belief than it is hard to ground belief. For as desire is glad to embrace the first show of comfort, so is desire desirous of perfect assurance: and that have I had of him, not only by necessary arguments to any of common sense, but by sufficient demonstrations. Lastly, he would have me send to Thessalia; but truly I am not as now in mind to do my honourable love so much wrong as so far to suspect him: yet poor soul, knows he no other but that do both suspect, neglect, yea, and detest him. For every day he finds one way or other to set forth himself unto me, but all are rewarded with like coldness of acceptation.
   ‘A few days since, he and Dametas had furnished themselves very richly to run at the ring before me. O how mad a sight it was to see Dametas, like rich tissue furred with lamb-skins! But O, how well it did with Dorus, to see with what a grace he presented himself before me on horseback, making majesty wait upon humbleness: how at the first, standing still with his eyes bent upon me, as though his motions were chained to my look, he so stayed till I caused Mopsa bid him do something upon his horse: which no sooner said but, with a kind rather of quick gesture than show of violence, you might see him come towards me beating the ground in so due time as no dancer can observe better measure. If you remember the ship we saw once when the sea went high upon the coast of Argos, so went the beast. But he, as if centaur-like he had been one piece with the horse, was no more moved than one is with the going of his own legs; and in effect so did he command him as his own limbs; for though he had both spurs and wand, they seemed rather marks of sovereignty than instruments of punishment, his hand and leg with most pleasing grace commanding without threatening, and rather remembering than chastising: at least if sometimes he did, it was so stolen as neither our eyes could discern it nor the horse with any change did complain of it; he ever going so just with the horse, either forth-right or turning, that it seemed as he borrowed the horse’s body so he lent the horse his mind. In the turning one might perceive the bridle-hand something gently stir, but indeed so gently as it did rather distil virtue than use violence. Himself (which methinks is strange) showing at one instant both steadiness and nimbleness; sometimes making him turn close to the ground, like a cat when scratchingly she wheels about after a mouse; sometimes with a little more rising before, now like a raven leaping from ridge to ridge, then like one of Dametas’ kids bound over the hillocks; and all so done as neither the lusty kind showed any roughness nor the easier any idleness; but still like a well-obeyed master, whose beck is enough for a discipline, ever concluding each thing he did with his face to me-wards, as if thence came not only the beginning but ending of his motions.
   The sport was to see Dametas, how he was tossed from the saddle to the mane of the horse and thence to the ground, giving his gay apparel almost as foul an outside as it had an inside. But as before he had ever said he wanted but horse and apparel to be as brave a courtier as the best, so now bruised with proof, he proclaimed it a folly for a man of wisdom to put himself under the tuition of a beast, so as Dorus was fain alone to take the ring. Wherein truly at least my womanish eyes could not discern but that taking his staff from his thigh, the descending it a little down, the getting of it up into the rest, the letting of the point fall, and taking the ring, was but all one motion - at least, if they were divers motions, they did so stealingly slip one into another as the latter part was ever in hand before the eye could discern the former was ended. Indeed Dametas found fault that he showed no more strength in shaking of his staff; but to my conceit the fine cleanness of bearing it was exceeding delightful.
   But how delightful soever it was, my delight might well be in niy soul, but it never went to look out of the window to do him any comfort But how much more I found reason to like him, the more I set all the strength of mind to suppress it or at least to conceal it. Indeed I must confess that, as some physicians have told me, when one is cold outwardly he is not inwardly, so truly the cold ashes laid upon my fire did not take the nature of fire from it Full often hath my breast swollen with keeping my sighs imprisoned. Full often have the tears I drave back from mine eyes turned back to drown my heart But alas, what did that help poor Dorus, whose eyes, being his diligent intelligencers, could carry unto him no other news but discomfortable? I think no day passed but by some one invention he would appear unto me to testify his love. One time he danced the matachin dance in armour (O, with what a graceful dexterity!) I think to make me see that he had been brought up in such exercises. Another time he persuaded his master, to make my time seem shorter, in manner of a dialogue to play Priamus while he played Paris. Think, sweet Philoclea, what a Priamus we had: but truly, my Paris was a Paris and more than a Paris, who, while in a savage apparel, with naked neck, arms and legs, he made love to Oenone, you might well see by his changed countenance and true tears that he felt the part he played. Tell me, sweet Philoclea, did you ever see such a shepherd? Tell me, did you ever hear of such a prince? And then tell me if a small or unworthy assault have conquered me. Truly I would hate my life if I thought vanity led me. But since my parents deal so cruelly with me, it is time for me to trust something to my own judgement Yet hitherto have my looks been as I told you, which, continuing after many of these his fruitless trials, have wrought such change in him as I tell you true,' - with that word she laid her hand upon her quaking side - 'I do not a little fear him. See what a letter this is,' - then drew she the curtain and took the letter from under her pillow - ‘which today, with an afflicted humbleness, he delivered me, pretending before Mopsa that I should read it unto her to mollify, forsooth, her iron stomach.' With that she read the letter, containing thus much:
   Most blessed paper, which shalt kiss that hand whereto all blessedness is in nature a servant, do not yet disdain to carry with thee the woeful words of a miser now despairing: neither be afraid to appear before her, bearing the base title of the sender. For no sooner shall that divine hand touch thee but that thy baseness shall be turned to most high preferment. Therefore mourn boldly, my ink, for while she looks upon you, your blackness will shine. Cry out boldly my lamentation, for while she reads you, your cries will be music. Say then (O happy messenger of a most unhappy message) that the too soon born and too late dying creature, which dares not speak, no not look, no not scarcely think (as from his miserable self, unto her heavenly highness) only presumes to desire thee (in the time that her eyes and voice do exalt thee) to say, and in this manner to say, not from him - O no, that were not fit - but of him, thus much unto her sacred judgement: ‘O you, the only honour to women, to men the only admiration; you that being armed by love, defy him that armed you, in this high estate wherein you have placed me, yet let me remember him to whom I am bound for bringing me to your presence; and let me remember him, who (since he is yours, how mean soever he be) it is reason you have an account of him. The wretch (yet your wretch) though with languishing steps, runs fast to his grave; and will you suffer a temple (how poorly built soever, but yet a temple of your deity) to be razed? But he dieth: it is most true, he dieth; and he in whom you live, to obey you, dieth. Whereof though he plain, be doth not complain, for it is a harm but no wrong which he hath received. He dies, because in woeful language all his senses tell him that such is your pleasure: for since you will not that he live, alas, alas, what followeth of the most ruined Dorus but his end? End then, evil-destined Dorus, end; and end thou, woeful letter, end; for it sufficeth her wisdom to know that her heavenly will shall be accomplished.’
   ‘O my Philoclea, is he a person to write these words? And are these words lightly to be regarded? But if you had seen, when with trembling hand he had delivered it, how he went away, as if he had been but the coffin that carried himself to his sepulchre. Two times, I must confess, I was about to take courtesy into mine eyes, but both times the former resolution stopped the entry of it, so that he departed without obtaining any further kindness. But he was no sooner out of the door but that I looked to the door kindly; and truly the fear of him ever since hath put me into such perplexity as now you found me.'
   ‘Ah my Pamela,’ said Philoclea, ‘leave sorrow. The river of your tears will soon lose his fountain. It is in your hand as well to stitch up his life again as it was before to rent it.' And so, though with self-grieved mind, she comforted her sister, till sleep came to bathe himself in Pamela’s fair weeping eyes.
   Which when Philoclea found, wringing her hands, ‘O me/ said she, ‘indeed the only subject of the destinies’ displeasure, whose greatest fortunateness is more unfortunate than my sister’s greatest unfortunateness. Alas, she weeps because she would be no sooner happy: I weep because I can never be happy. Her tears flow from pity; mine from being too far lower than the reach of pity. Yet do I not envy thee, dear Pamela, I do not envy thee: only I could wish that being thy sister in nature, I were not so far off akin in fortune.’
   CHAPTER 6
   But the darkness of sorrow overshadowing her mind as the night did her eyes, they were both content to hide themselves under the wings of sleep, till the next morning had almost lost his name before the two sweet sleeping sisters awaked from dreams which flattered them with more comfort than their waking could or would consent unto. For then, they were called up by Miso, who, having been with Gynecia, had received commandment to be continually with her daughters, and particularly not to let Zelmane and Philoclea have any private conference but that she should he present to hear what passed. Miso, having now her authority increased, came with scowling eyes to deliver a slavering good morrow to the two ladies, telling them it was a shame for them to mar their complexions, yea and conditions too, with long lying abed, and that when she was of their age, she trowed, she would have made a handkerchief by that time a day. The two sweet princesses with a smiling silence answered her entertainment and, obeying her direction, covered their dainty beauties with the glad clothes. But as soon as Pamela was ready — and sooner she was than her sister — the agony of Dorus giving a fit to herself which the words of his letter (lively imprinted in her mind) still remembered her of, she called to Mopsa and willed her to fetch Dorus to speak with her because, she said, she would take further judgement of him before she would move Dametas to grant her in marriage unto him. Mopsa, as glad as of sweetmeat to go of such an errand, quickly returned with Dorus to Pamela, who intended both by speaking with him to give some comfort to his passionate heart and withal, to hear some part of his life past, which although fame had already delivered unto her, yet she desired in more particular certainties to have it from so beloved an historian. Yet the sweetness of virtue’s disposition, jealous even over itself, suffered her not to enter abruptly into questions of Musidorus (whom she was half ashamed she did love so well, and more than half sorry she could love no better) but thought best first to make her talk arise of Pyrocles and his virtuous father: which thus she did.
   ‘Dorus,’ said she, ‘you told me the last day that Plangus was deceived in that he affirmed the prince Musidorus was drowned: but, withal, you confessed his cousin Pyrocles perished; of whom certainly in that age there was a great loss, since, as I have heard, he was a young prince of whom all men expected as much as man’s power could bring forth, and yet virtue promised for him their expectation should not be deceived.’
   ‘Most excellent lady,’ said Dorus, ‘no expectation in others nor hope in himself could aspire to a higher mark than to be thought worthy to be praised by your judgment, and made worthy to be praised by your mouth. But most sure it is, that as his fame could by no means get so sweet and noble an air to fly in as in your breath, so could not you (leaving yourself aside) find in the world a fitter subject of commendation: as noble as a long succession of royal ancestors, famous and famous for victories, could make him; of shape most lovely, and yet of mind more lovely; valiant, courteous, wise - what should I say more? Sweet Pyrocles, excellent Pyrocles, what can my words but wrong thy perfections, which I would to God in some small measure thou had'st bequeathed to him that ever must have thy virtues in admiration, that, masked at least in them, I might have found some more gracious acceptation.’
   With that he imprisoned his look for a while upon Mopsa, who thereupon fell into a very wide smiling.
   ‘Truly,’ said Pamela, ‘Dorus, I like well your mind that can raise itself out of so base a fortune as yours is, to think of the imitating so excellent a prince as Pyrocles was. Who shoots at the mid-day sun, though he be sure he shall never hit the mark, yet as sure he is he shall shoot higher than who aims but at a bush. But I pray you, Dorus,’ said she, ‘t^ll me, since I perceive you are well acquainted with that story, what prince was that Euarchus, father to Pyrocles, of whom so much fame goes for his rightly royal virtues, or by what ways he got that opinion. And then so descend to the causes of his sending first away from him, and then to him for that excellent son of his, with the discourse of his life and loss: and therein you may (if you list) say something of that same Musidorus his cousin, because they going together, the story of Pyrocles (which I only desire) may be the better understood.’
   ‘Incomparable lady,’ said he, ‘your commandment doth not only give me the will but the power to obey you, such influence hath your excellency. And first, for that famous king Euarchus, he was, at this time you speak of, king of Macedon, a kingdom which in elder time had such a sovereignty over all the provinces of Greece that even the particular kings therein did acknowledge, with more or less degrees of homage, some kind of fealty thereunto, asamong the rest, even this now most noble (and by you ennobled) g om of Arcadia. But he, when he came to his crown, finding by his latter ancestors’ either negligence or misfortune that in some ages many of those duties had been intermitted, would never stir up old titles (how apparent soever) whereby the public peace, with the loss of many not guilty souls, should be broken; but contenting himself to guide that ship wherein the heavens had placed him showed no less magnanimity in dangerless despising than others in dangerous affecting the multiplying of kingdoms, for the hath since borne enow bleeding witnesses that it was no want of true courage. Who as he was most wise to see what was best, and most just in the performing what he saw and temperate in abstaining from anything anyway contrary, so think I, no thought can imagine a greater heart to see and contemn danger, where danger would offer to make any wrongful threatening upon him. A prince that indeed especially measured his greatness by his goodness: and if for anything he loved greatness, it was because therein he might exercise his goodness. A prince of a goodly aspect, and the more goodly by a grave majesty wherewith his mind did deck his outward graces; strong of body, and so much the stronger as he by a well-disciplined exercise taught it both to do and suffer. Of age, so as he was about fifty years when his nephew Musidorus took on such shepherdish apparel for the love of the world’s paragon as I now wear.
   ‘This king, left orphan both of father and mother (whose father and grandfather likewise had died young) he found his estate (when he came to the age which allowed his authority) so disjointed even in the noblest and strongest limbs of government that the name of a king was grown even odious to the people, his authority having been abused by those great lords and little kings who in those between-times of reigning, by unjust favouring those that were partially theirs, and oppressing them that would defend their liberty against them, had brought in (by a more felt than seen manner of proceeding) the worst kind of Oligarchy: that is, when men are governed indeed by a few, and yet are not taught to know what those few be to whom they should obey.
   ‘For they, having the power of kings but not the nature of kings, used the authority as men do their farms of which they see within a year they shall go out, making the king’s sword strike whom they hated, the king's purse reward whom they loved; and (which is worst of all) making the royal countenance serve to undermine the royal sovereignty. For the subjects could taste no sweeter fruits of having a king than grievous taxations to serve vain purposes; laws made rather to find faults than to prevent faults; the court of prince rather deemed as a privileged place of unbridled licentiousness than as the abiding of him who, as a father, should give a fatherly example unto his people. Hence grew a very dissolution of all estates, while the great men (by the nature of ambition never satisfied) grew factious among themselves, and the underlings glad indeed to be underlings to them they hated least, to preserve them from such they hated most. Men of virtue suppressed, lest their shining should discover the others’ filthiness; and at length virtue itself almost forgotten when it had no hopeful end whereunto to be directed: old men long nuzzled in corruption, scorning them that would seek reformation: young men very fault-finding but very faulty, and so given to new-fangleness both of manners, apparel and each thing else, by the custom of self-guilty evil glad to change, though oft for a worse: merchandise abused, and so towns decayed for want of just and natural liberty: offices, even of judging souls, sold: public defences neglected; and in sum (lest too long I trouble you) all awry, and (which wried it to the most wry course of all) wit abused rather to feign reason why it should be amiss than how it should be amended.
   ‘In this, and a much worse plight than it is fit to trouble your excellent ears withal, did the king Euarchus find his estate when he took upon him the regiment: which, by reason of the long stream of abuse, he was forced to establish by some even extreme severity, not so much for the very faults themselves (which he rather sought to prevent than to punish) as for the faulty ones, who, strong even in their faults, scorned his youth, and could not learn to digest that the man which they so long had used to mask their own appetites should now be the reducer of them into order. But so soon as some few (but indeed notable) examples had thundered a duty into the subjects' hearts, he soon showed no baseness of suspicion nor the basest baseness of envy could any whit rule such a ruler. But then shined forth indeed all love among them when an aweful fear, engendered by justice, did make that love most lovely; his first and principal care being to appear unto his people such as he would have them be, and to be such as he appeared; making his life the example of his laws, and his laws, as it were, his axioms arising out of his deeds. So that within small time he won a singular love in his people and engraffed singular confidence. For how could they choose but love him, whom they found so truly to love them? - he even in reason disdaining that they that have charge of beasts should love their charge and care for them, and that he that was to govern the most excellent creature should not love so noble a charge. And therefore, where most princes (seduced by flattery to build upon false grounds of government) make themselves, as it were, another thing from the people, and so count it gain what they get from them and (as if it were two counter-balances, that their estate goes highest when the people goes lowest) by a fallacy of argument thinking themselves most kings when the subject is most basely subjected; the contrariwise (virtuously and wisely acknowledging that he with his people made all but one politic body whereof himself was the head) even so cared for them as he would for his own limbs; never restraining their liberty without it stretched to licentiousness, nor pulling from them their goods which they found were not employed to the purchase of a greater good; but in all his actions showing a delight in their welfare, brought that to pass that, while by force he took nothing, by their love he had all. In sum, peerless princess, I might as easily set down the whole art of government as to lay before your eyes the picture of his proceedings. But in such sort he flourished in the sweet comfort of doing much good, when, by an occasion of leaving his country, he was forced to bring forth his virtue of magnanimity, as before he had done of justice.
   ‘He had only one sister, a lady (lest I should too easily fall to partial praises of her) of whom it may be justly said that she was no unfit branch to the noble stock whereof she was come. Her he had given in marriage to Dorilaus, prince of Thessalia, not so much to make a friendship as to confirm the friendship between their posterity, which between them, by the likeness of virtue, had been long before made; for certainly, Dorilaus could need no amplifier’s mouth for the highest point of praise.’
   ‘Who hath not heard,’ said Pamela, ‘of the valiant, wise and just Dorilaus whose unripe death doth yet, so many years since, draw tears from virtuous eyes? And indeed, my father is wont to speak of nothing with greater admiration than of the notable friendship (a rare thing in princes, more rare between princes) that so holily was observed to the last, of those two excellent men. But,’ said she, ‘go on, I pray you.'
   ‘Dorilaus,' said he, ‘having married his sister, had his marriage in short time blest (for so are folk wont to say, how unhappy soever the children after grow) with a son, whom they named Musidorus, of whom I must needs first speak before I come to Pyrocles, because, as he was born first, so upon his occasion grew, as I may say, accidentally, the other's birth. For scarcely was Musidorus made partaker of this oft-blinding light, when there were found numbers of soothsayers who affirmed strange and incredible things should be performed by that child; whether the heavens at that time listed to play with ignorant mankind, or that flattery be so presumptuous as even at times to borrow the face of divinity. But certainly, so did the boldness of their affirmation accompany the greatness of what they did affirm (even descending to particularities, what kingdoms he should overcome) that the king of Phrygia, who over-superstitiously thought himself touched in the matter, sought by force to destroy the infant to prevent his after expectations, because a skilful man, having compared his nativity With the child, so told him. Foolish man, either vainly fearing what was not to be feared or not considering that if it were a work of the superior powers, the heavens at length are never children. But so he did, and by the aid of the kings of Lydia and Crete Coining together their armies) invaded Thessalia, and brought Dorilaus to some behind-hand of fortune, when his faithful friend and brother Euarchus came so mightily to his succour that, with some interchanging changes of fortune, they begat of just war the best child, Peace. In which time Euarchus made a cross-marriage also with Dorilaus' sister, and shortly left her with child of the famous Pyrocles, driven to return to the defence of his own country, which in his absence (helped with some of the ill-contented nobility) the mighty king of Thrace and his brother, king of Pannonia, had invaded.
   ‘The success of those wars was too notable to be unknown to your ears, to which it seems all worthy fame hath glory to come unto. But there was Dorilaus, valiantly requiting his friend s help, in a great battle deprived of life, his obsequies being no more solemnized by the tears of his partakers than the blood of his enemies; with so piercing a sorrow to the constant heart of Euarchus that the news of his son’s birth could lighten his countenance with no show of comfort, although all the comfort that might be in a child, truth itself in him forthwith delivered. For what fortune only soothsayers foretold of Musidorus, that, all men might see prognosticated in Pyrocles, both heavens and earth giving tokens of the coming forth of an heroical virtue. The senate house of the planets was at no time so set for the decreeing of perfection in a man, as at that time all folks skilful therein did acknowledge. Only love was threatened, and promised to him, and so to his cousin, as both the tempest and haven of their best years. But as death may have prevented Pyrocles, so unworthiness must be the death of Musidorus.
   CHAPTER 7
   But the mother of Pyrocles shortly after her childbirth dying was cause that Euarchus recommended the care of his only son to his sister, doing it the rather because the war continued in cruel heat betwixt him and those evil neighbours of his. In which meantime those young princes, the only comforters of that virtuous widow, grew on so that Pyrocles taught admiration to the hardest conceits, Musidorus (perchance because among his subjects) exceedingly beloved; and by the good order of Euarchus (well performed by his sister) they were so brought up that all the sparks of virtue which nature had kindled in them were so blown to give forth their uttermost heat, that, justly it may be affirmed, they inflamed the affections of all that knew them. For almost before they could perfectly speak, they began to receive conceits not unworthy of the best speakers, excellent devices being used, to make even their sports profitable: images of battles and fortifications being then delivered to their memory, which after, their stronger judgments might dispense; the delight of tales being converted to the knowledge of all the stories of worthy princes, both to move them to do nobly and teach them how to do nobly; the beauty of virtue still being set before their eyes, and that taught them with far more diligent care than grammatical rules; their bodies exercised in all abilities both of doing and suffering, and their minds acquainted by degrees with dangers; and in sum, all bent to the making up of princely minds: no servile fear used towards them, nor any other violent restraint, but still as to princes, so that a habit of commanding was naturalized in them, and therefore the further from tyranny: Nature having done so much for them in nothing as that it made them lords of truth, whereon all the other goods were builded.
   ‘Among which, nothing I so much delight to recount as the memorable friendship that grew betwixt the two princes, such as made them more like than the likeness of all other virtues, and made them more near one to the other than the nearness of their blood could aspire unto; which I think grew the faster, and the faster was tied between them by reason that Musidorus being elder by three or four years, it was neither so great a difference in age as did take away the delight in society, and yet by the difference there was taken away the occasion of childish contentions till they had both passed over the humour of such contentions. For Pyrocles bare reverence full of love to Musidorus, and Musidorus had a delight full of love in Pyrocles. Musidorus, what he had learned either for body or mind, would teach it to Pyrocles; and Pyrocles was so glad to learn of none as of Musidorus: till Pyrocles, being come to sixteen years of age, he seemed so to overrun his age in growth,strength and all things following it that not Musidorus, no nor any man living, I think, could perform any action, either on horse or foot, more strongly, or deliver that strength more nimbly, or become the delivery more gracefully, or employ all more virtuously. Wliich may well seem wonderful: but wonders are no wonders in a wonderful subject.
   ‘At which time, understanding that the king Euarchus, after so many years’ war and the conquest of all Pannonia and almost Thrace, had now brought the conclusion of all to the siege of Byzantium (to the raising of which siege great forces were made) they would needs fall to the practice of those virtues which they before learned. And therefore the mother of Musidorus nobly yielding over her own affects to her children’s good (for a mother she was in effect to them both) the rather that they might help her beloved brother, they brake off all delays; which Musidorus for his part thought already had devoured too much of his good time, but that he had once granted a boon (before he knew what it was) to his dear friend Pyrocles that he would never seek the adventures of arms until he might go with him, which having fast bound his heart (a true slave to faith) he had bid a tedious delay of following his own humour for his friend’s sake; till now being both sent for by Euarchus, and finding Pyrocles able every way to go through with that kind of life, he was as desirous for his sake as for his own to enter into it.
   ‘So therefore preparing a navy, that they might go like themselves, and not only bring the comfort of their presence but of their power to their dear parent Euarchus, they recommended themselves to the sea, leaving the shore of Thessalia full of tears and vows, and were received thereon with so smooth and smiling a face as if Neptune had as then learned falsely to fawn on princes. The wind was like a servant, waiting behind them so just, that they might fill the sails as they listed; and the best sailors, showing themselves less covetous of his liberality, so tempered it that they all kept together like a beautiful flock which so well could obey their master’s pipe; without sometimes, to delight the princes’ eyes, some two or three of them would strive who could (either by the cunning of well spending the wind's breath, or by the advantageous building of their moving houses) leave their fellows behind them in the honour of speed: while the two princes had leisure to see the practice of that which before they had learned by books: to consider the art of catching the wind prisoner to no other end but to run away with it; to see how beauty and use can so well agree together that of all the trinkets wherewith they are attired, there is not one but serves to some necessary purpose. And, O lord, to see the admirable power and noble effects of love, whereby the seeming insensible lodestone, with a secret beauty (holding the spirit of iron in it) can draw that hard-hearted thing unto it and, like a virtuous mistress, not only make it bow itself, but with it make it aspire to so high a love as of the heavenly poles, and thereby to bring forth the noblest deeds that the children of the earth can boast of. And so the princes delighting their conceits with confirming their knowledge, seeing wherein the sea-discipline differed from land-service, they had for a day and almost a whole night as pleasing entertainment as the falsest heart could give to him he means worst to.
   ‘But by that the next morning began a little to make a gilden show of a good meaning, there arose even with the sun a veil of dark clouds before his face, which shortly, like ink poured into water, had blacked over all the face of heaven, preparing, as it were, a mournful stage for a tragedy to be played on. For forthwith the winds began to speak louder and, as in a tumultuous kingdom, to think themselves fittest instruments of commandment; and blowing whole storms of hail and rain upon them, they were sooner in danger than they could almost bethink themselves of change. For then the traitorous sea began to swell in pride against the afflicted navy under which, while the heaven favoured them, it had lain so calmly, making mountains of itself over which the tossed and tottering ship should climb, to be straight carried down again to a pit of hellish darkness; with such cruel blows against the sides of the ship (that, which way soever it went, was still in his malice) that there was left neither power to stay nor way to escape. And shortly had it so dissevered the loving company which the day before had tarried together, that most of them never met again but were swallowed up in his never satisfied mouth. Some indeed, as since was known, after long wandering returned into Thessalia; others recovered Byzantium, and served Euarchus in his war.
   ‘But in the ship wherein the princes were (now left as much alone as proud lords be when fortune fails them) though they employed all industry to save themselves, yet what they did was rather for duty to nature than hope to escape. So ugly a darkness, as if it would prevent the night’s coming, usurped the right, which (accompanied sometimes with thunders, always wit horrible noises of the chafing winds) made the master and pilots so astonished that they knew not how to direct, and if they knew, they could scarcely (when they directed) hear then own whistle. For the sea strave with the winds which should be louder, and the shrouds of the ship, wih a ghastful noise to them that were in it, witnessed that their ruin was the wager of the others’ contention, and the heaven roaring out thunders the more amazed them, as having those powers for enemies. Certainly there is no danger carries with it more horror than that which grows in those floating kingdoms. For that dwelling place is unnatural to mankind; and then the terribleness of the continual motion, the desolation of the far-being from comfort, the eye and the ear having ugly images ever before it, doth still vex the mind, even when it is best armed against it.
   ‘But thus the day passed (if that might be called a day) while the cunningest mariners were so conquered by the storm as they thought it best with stricken sails to yield to be governed by it: the valiantest feeling inward dismayedness, and yet the fearfullest ashamed fully to show it, seeing that the princes (who were to part from the greatest fortunes) did in their countenances accuse no point of fear; but encouraging them to do what might be done (putting their hands to every most painful office) taught them at one instant to promise themselves the best and yet to despise the worst. But so were they carried by the tyranny of the wind and the treason of the sea all that night, which the elder it was, the more wayward it showed itself towards them: till the next morning (known to be a morning better by the hour-glass than by the day’s clearness) having run fortune as blindly as itself ever was painted, lest the conclusion should not answer to the rest of the play, they were driven upon a rock, which (hidden with those outrageous waves) did, as it were, closely dissemble his cruel mind, till, with an unbelieved violence (but to them that have tried it) the ship ran upon it; and seeming willinger to perish than to have her course stayed, redoubled her blows till she had broken herself in pieces and, as it were, tearing out her own bowels to feed the sea’s greediness, left nothing within it but despair of safety and expectation of a loathsome end.
   ‘There was to be seen the divers manner of minds in distress: some sat upon the top of the poop weeping and wailing till the sea swallowed them; someone, more able to abide death than fear °f death, cut his own throat to prevent drowning; some prayed, and there wanted not of them which cursed, as if the heavens could not be moie angry than they were. But a monstrous cry begotten of many roaring voices was able to infect with fear a mind that had not prevented it with the power of reason.
   ‘But the princes (using the passions of fearing evil, and desiring to escape only to serve the rule of virtue, not to abandon one’s self) leapt to a rib of the ship which, broken from his fellows, floated with more likelihood to do service than any other limb of that ruinous body; upon which there had gotten already two brethren, Well known servants of theirs; and straight they four were carried out of sight, in that huge rising of the sea, from the rest of the ship. But the piece they were on sinking by little and little under them, not able to support the weight of so many, the brethren (the elder whereof was Leucippus, the younger Nelsus) showed themselves right faithful and grateful servants unto them. Grateful, I say, for this cause: those two gentlemen had been taken prisoners in the great war the king of Phrygia made upon Thessalia In the time of Musidorus’ infancy; and having been sold into another country, though peace fell after between those realms, could not be delivered (because of their valour known) but for a far greater sum than either all their friends were able or the dowager willing to make, in respect of the great expenses herself and people had been put to in those wars; and so had they remained in prison about thirteen years, when the two young princes, hearing speeches of their good deserts, found means both by selling all the jewels they had of great price, and by giving under their hands great estates when they should come to be kings (which promises their virtue promised for them should be kept) to get so much treasure as redeemed them from captivity. This remembered, and kindly remembered by these two brothers, perchance helped by a natural duty to their princes’ blood, they willingly left hold of the board, committing themselves to the sea’s rage, and even when they meant to die, themselves praying for the princes’ lives. It is true that neither the pain nor danger so moved the princes’ hearts as the tenderness of that loving part far from glory, having so few lookers on; far from hope of reward, since themselves were sure to perish.
   
   CHAPTER 8 
   ‘But now of all the royal navy they lately had, they had left but one little piece of one ship whereon they kept themselves, in all truth having interchanged their cares while either cared for other, each comforting and counselling how to labour for the better and to abide the worse. But so fell it out that as they were carried by the tide (which there, seconded by the storm, ran exceeding swiftly) Musidorus seeing, as he thought, Pyrocles not well upon the board, as he Would with his right hand have helped him on better, he had no sooner unfastened his hold but that a wave forcibly spoiled his weaker hand of hold; and so for a time parted those friends, each crying to the other, but the noise of the sea drowned their farewell. But Pyrocles (then careless of death, if it had come by any means but his own) was shortly brought out of the sea's fury to the land’s comfort when (in my conscience) I know that comfort was but bitter unto him; and bitter indeed it fell out even in itself to be unto him.
   ‘For being cast on land much bruised and beaten both with the sea’s hard farewell and the shore’s rude welcome, and even almost deadly tired with the length of his uncomfortable labour, as he was walking up to discover somebody to whom he might go for relief, there came straight running unto him certain, who (as it was after known) by appointment watched with many others in divers places along the coast; who laid hands on him, and without either questioning with him or showing will to hear him, like men fearful to appear curious, or (which was worse) having no regard to the hard plight he was in (being so wet and weak) they carried him some miles thence to a house of a principal officer of that country: who with no more civility (though with much more busyness than those under-fellows had showed) began in captious manner to put interrogatories unto him; to which he, unused to such entertainment, did shortly and plainly answer what he was and how he came thither. But that no sooner known, with numbers of armed men to guard him (for mischief, not from mischief) he was sent to the king’s court, which as then was not above a day’s journey off, with letters from that officer containing his own serviceable diligence in discovering so great a personage; adding withal more than was true of his conjectures, because he would endear his own service.
   'This country whereon he fell was Phrygia, and it was to the king thereof to whom he was sent: a prince of a melancholy constitution both of body and mind; wickedly sad, ever musing of horrible matters; suspecting, or rather condemning all men of evil, because his mind had no eye to espy goodness; and therefore accusing sycophants, of all men, did best sort to his nature; but therefore not seeming sycophants, because of no evil they said, they could bring any new or doubtful thing unto him but such as already he had been apt to determine, so as they came but as proofs of his wisdom: fearful, and never secure, while the feax he had figured in his mind had any possibility of event: a toad-like retiredness and closeness of mind, nature teaching the odiousness of poison and the danger of odiousness. Yet while youth lasted in him, the exercises of that age, and his humour (not yet fully discovered) made him something the more frequentable and less dangerous. But after that years began to come on with some, though more seldom, shows of a bloody nature, and that the prophecy of Musidorus’ destiny came to his ears (delivered unto him, and received of him with the hardest interpretation, as though his subjects did delight in the hearing thereof), then gave he himself indeed to the full current of his disposition, especially after the war of Thessalia, wherein (though in truth wrongly) he deemed his unsuccess proceeded of their unwillingness to have him prosper. And then thinking himself contemned, knowing no countermine against contempt but terror, began to let nothing pass which might bear the colour of a fault, without sharp punishment: and when he wanted faults, excellency grew a fault; and it was sufficient to make one guilty, that he had power to be guilty. And as there is no humour to which impudent poverty cannot make itself serviceable, so were there enow of those of desperate ambition who would build their houses upon others' ruins, which after should fall by like practices; so as servitude came mainly upon that poor people, whose deeds were not only punished but words corrected and even thoughts by some mean or other pulled out of them, while suspicion bred the mind of cruelty, and the effects of cruelty stirred a new cause of suspicion. And in this plight, full of watchful fearfulness, did the storm deliver sweet Pyrocles to the stormy mind of that tyrant; all men that did such wrong to so rare a stranger (whose countenance deserved both pity and admiration) condemning themselves as much in their hearts as they did brag in their faces.
   ‘But when this bloody king knew what he was, and in what order he and his cousin Musidorus (so much of him feared) were come out of Thessalia, assuredly thinking (because ever thinking the worst) that those forces were provided against him, glad of the perishing (as he thought) of Musidorus, determined in public sort to put Pyrocles to death. For having quite lost the way of nobleness, he strave to climb to the height of terribleness; and thinking to make all men a-dread to make such one an enemy who would not spare nor fear to kill so great a prince, and lastly, having nothing in him why to make him his friend, he thought he would take him away from being his enemy. The day was appointed, and all things appointed for that cruel blow, in so solemn an order as if they would set forth tyranny in most gorgeous decking: the princely youth, of invincible valour yet so unjustly subjected to such outrageous wrong, carrying himself in all his demeanour so constantly, abiding extremity, that one might see it was the cutting away of the greatest hope of the world and destroying virtue in his sweetest growth.
   ‘But so it fell out that his death was prevented by a rare example of friendship in Musidorus who, being almost drowned, had been taken up by a fisherman belonging to the kingdom of Pontus; and being there, and understanding the full discourse - as fame was very prodigal of so notable an accident - in what case Pyrocles was; learning withal that his hate was far more to him than to Pyrocles, he found means to acquaint himself with a nobleman of that country, to whom largely discovering what he was, he found him a most fit instrument to effectuate his desire. For this nobleman had been one who in many wars had served Euarchus, and had been so mind-stricken by the beauty of virtue in that noble king that, though not born his subject, he ever professed himself his servant. His desire therefore to him was to keep Musidorus in a strong castle of his, and then to make the king of Phrygia understand that if he would deliver Pyrocles, Musidorus would willingly put himself into his hands, knowing well that how thirsty soever he was of Pyrocles’ blood, he would rather drink that of Musidorus.
   ‘The nobleman was loth to preserve one by the loss of another, but time urging resolution, the importunity of Musidorus (who showed a mind not to over-live Pyrocles) with the affection he bare to Euarchus so prevailed that he carried this strange offer of Musidorus, which by that tyrant was greedily accepted.
   ‘And so upon security of both sides, they were interchanged. Where I may not omit the work of friendship in Pyrocles, who both in speech and countenance to Musidorus well showed that he thought himself injured and not relieved by him; asking him what he had ever seen in him why he could not bear the extremities of mortal accidents as well as any man, and why he should envy him the glory of suffering death for his friend’s cause, and, as it were, rob him of his own possession? But in this notable contention (where the conquest must be the conqueror’s destruction, and safety the punishment of the conquered) Musidorus prevailed because he was a more welcome prize to the unjust king that wished none well, to them worse than others, and to him worst of all: and as cheerfully going towards as Pyrocles went frowardly fromward his death, he was delivered to the king, who could not be enough sure of him without he fed his own eyes upon one whom he had begun to fear as soon as the other began to be.
   Yet because he would in one act both make ostentation of his own felicity (into whose hands his most feared enemy was fallen) and withal cut off such hopes from his suspected subjects (when they should know certainly he was dead) with much more skilful cruelty and horrible solemnity he caused each thing to be prepared for his triumph of tyranny. And so the day being come, he was led forth by many armed men, who often had been the fortifiers of wickedness, to the place of execution; where coming with a mind comforted in that he had done such service to Pyrocles, this strange encounter he had.
   ‘The excelling Pyrocles was no sooner delivered by the king’s servants to a place of liberty than he bent his wit and courage - and what would they not bring to pass? - how either to deliver Musidorus or to perish with him. And finding he could get in that country no forces sufficient by force to rescue him, to bring himself to die with him (little hoping of better event) he put himself in poor raiment, and by the help of some few crowns he took of that nobleman (who, full of sorrow, though not knowing the secret of his intent, suffered him to go in such order from him) he - even he, born to the greatest expectation and of the greatest blood that any prince might be - submitted himself to be servant to the executioner that should put to death Musidorus: a far not- abler proof of his friendship, considering the height of his mind, than any death could be. That bad officer, not suspecting him (being arrayed fit for such an estate and having his beauty hidden by many foul spots he artificially put upon his face) gave him leave not only to wear a sword himself but to bear his sword prepared for the justified murder.
   And so Pyrocles taking his time, when Musidorus was upon the scaffold (separated somewhat from the rest, as allowed to say something) he stepped unto him, and putting the sword into his hand, not bound (a point of civility the officers used towards him because they doubted no such enterprise) "Musidorus,” said he, “die nobly.” In truth, never man, between joy before knowledge what to be glad of and fear after considering his case, had such a confusion of thoughts as I had, when I saw Pyrocles so near me.’
   But with that Dorus blushed and Pamela smiled, and Dorus the more blushed at her smiling, and she the more smiled at his blushing, because he had, with the remembrance of that plight he was in, forgotten in speaking of himself to use the third person.
   But Musidorus turned again her thoughts from his cheeks to his tongue in this sort: ‘But,’ said he, ‘when they were with swords in hands, not turning backs one to the other (for there they knew was no place of defence) but making it a preservation in not hoping to be preserved, and now acknowledging themselves subject to death, meaning only to do honour to their princely birth, they flew amongst them all (for all were enemies) and had quickly, either with flight or death, left none upon the scaffold to annoy them: wherein Pyrocles, the excellent Pyrocles, did such wonders beyond belief as was able to lead Musidorus to courage, though he had been born a coward. But indeed just rage and desperate virtue did such effects that the popular sort of the beholders began to be almost superstitiously amazed as at effects beyond mortal power. But the king with angry threatenings from out a window (where he was not ashamed the world should behold him a beholder) commanded his guard and the rest of his soldiers to hasten their death. But many of them lost their bodies to lose their souls, when the princes grew almost so weary as they were ready to be conquered with conquering.
   ‘But as they were still fighting with weak arms and strong hearts, it happened that one of the soldiers (commanded to go up after his fellows against the princes) having received a light hurt, more wounded in his heart, went back with as much diligence as he came up with modesty: which another of his fellows seeing, to pick a thank of the king, strake him upon the face, reviling him that (so accompanied) he would run away from so few. But he (as many times it falls out) only valiant when he was angry, in revenge thrust him through, which with his death was straight revenged by a brother of his and that again requited by a fellow of the others. There began to be a great tumult amongst the soldiers; which seen and not understood by the people, used to fears but not used to be bold in them, some began to cry treason; and that voice straight multiplying itself, the king (O, the cowardice of a guilty conscience) before any man set upon him, fled away. Wherewith a bruit (either by art of some well-meaning men, or by such chance as such things often fall out by) ran from one to the other that the king was slain: wherewith certain young men of the bravest minds cried with a loud voice, “Liberty”; and encouraging the other citizens to follow them, set upon the guard and soldiers as chief instruments of tyranny: and quickly, aided by the princes, they had left none of them alive, nor any other in the city who they thought had in any sort set his hand to the work of their servitude, and, god knows, by the blindness of rage killing many guiltless persons, either for affinity to the tyrant or enmity to the tyrant-killers. But some of the wiser (seeing that a popular licence is indeed the many-headed tyranny) prevailed with the rest to make Musidorus their chief; choosing one of them (because princes) to defend them, and him (because elder and most hated of the tyrant) and by him to be ruled; whom forthwith they lifted up - Fortune, I think, smiling at her work therein, that a scaffold of execution should grow to a scaffold of coronation.
   ‘But by and by there came news of more certain truth, that the king was not dead but fled to a strong castle of his near hand, where he was gathering forces in all speed possible to suppress this mutiny. But now they had run themselves too far out of breath to go back again to the same career; and too well they knew the sharpness of his memory to forget such an injury. Therefore learning virtue of necessity, they continued resolute to obey Musidorus, who seeing what forces were in the city, with them issued against the tyrant while they were in this heat, before practices might be used to dissever them; and with them met the king, who likewise hoping little to prevail by time, knowing and finding his people’s hate, met him with little delay in the field, where himself was slain by Musidorus after he had seen his only son (a prince of great courage and beauty, but fostered in blood by his naughty father) slain by the hand of Pyrocles. This victory obtained with great and truly not undeserved honour to the two princes, the whole estates of the country with one consent gave the crown and all other marks of sovereignty to Musidorus, desiring nothing more than to live under such a government as they promised themselves of him.
   ‘But he, thinking it a greater greatness to give a kingdom than get a kingdom, understanding that there was left of the blood royal and next to the succession an aged gentleman of approved goodness (who had gotten nothing by his cousin’s power but danger from him and odiousness for him, having passed his time in modest secrecy and as much from intermeddling in matters of government as the greatness of his blood would suffer him) did, after having received the full power to his own hands, resign all to he nobleman; but with such conditions, and cautions of the conditions, as might assure the people (with as much assurance as worldly matters bear) that not only that governor, of whom indeed they looked for all good, but the nature of the government, should be no way apt to decline to tyranny.
   CHAPTER 9
   ‘This doing set forth no less his magnificence than the other act did his magnanimity; so that greatly praised of all; and justly beloved of the new king who in all both words and behaviour protested himself their tenant and liegeman, they were drawn thence to revenge those two servants of theirs, of whose memorable faith I told you, most excellent princess, in willingly giving themselves to be drowned for their sakes: but drowned indeed they were not, but got with painful swimming upon a rock, from whence, after being come as near famishing as before drowning, the weather breaking up, they were brought to the mainland of Pontus, the same country upon which Musidorus also was fallen, but not in so lucky a place.
   ‘For they were brought to the king of that country, a tyrant also, not through suspicion, greediness or revengefulness, as he of Phrygia, but, as I may term it, of a wanton cruelty; inconstant in his choice of friends, or rather never having a friend but a playfellow; of whom when he was weary, he could not otherwise rid himself than by killing them; giving sometimes prodigally, not because he loved them to whom he gave but because he lusted to give; punishing, not so much for hate or anger as because he felt not the smart of punishment; delighted to be flattered, at first for those virtues which were not in him, at length making his vices virtues worthy the flattering; with like judgement glorying when he had happened to do a thing well as when he had performed some notable mischief.
   ‘He chanced at that time - for indeed long time none lasted with him — to have next in use about him a man of the most envious disposition that, I think, ever infected the air with his breath; whose eyes could not look right upon any happy man, nor ears bear the burden of anybody’s praise; contrary to the natures of all other plagues, plagued with others’ well being; making happiness the ground of his unhappiness and good news the argument of his sorrow: in sum, a man whose favour no man could win but by being miserable.
   ‘And so because those two faithful servants of theirs came in miserable sort to that court, he was apt enough at first to favour them; and the king understanding of their adventure (wherein they had showed so constant a faith unto their lords) suddenly falls to take a pride in making much of them, extolling them with infinite praises, and praising himself in his heart in that he praised them. And by and by were they made great courtiers and in the way of minions; when advancement (the most mortal offence to envy) stirred up their former friend to overthrow his own work in them, taking occasijn upon the knowledge (newly come to the court) of the late death of the king of Phrygia destroyed by their two lords; who having been a near kinsman to this prince of Pontus, by this envious counsellor (partly with suspicion of practice, partly with glory of in part revenging his cousin’s death) the king was suddenly turned (and every turn with him was a downfall) to lock them up in prison as servants to his enemies, whom before he had never known nor (till that time one of his own subjects had entertained and dealt for them) did ever take heed of. But now earnest in every present humour, and making himself brave in his liking, he was content to give them just cause of offence when they had power to make just revenge. Yet did the princes send unto him before they entered into war, desiring their servants’ liberty. But he, swelling in their humbleness (like a bubble blown up with a small breath, broken with a great) forgetting, or never knowing humanity, caused their heads to be stricken off, by the advice of his envious counsellor, who now hated them so much the more as he foresaw their happiness in having such, and so fortunate masters; and sent them with unroyal reproaches to Musidorus and Pyrocles, as if they had done traitorously and not heroically in killing his tyrannical cousin.
   ‘But that injury went beyond all degree of reconcilement; so that they making forces in Phrygia (a kingdom wholly at their commandment by the love of the people and gratefulness of the king) they entered his country; and wholly conquering it, with such deeds as at least fame said were excellent, took the king; and by Musidorus’ commandment (Pyrocles’ heart more inclining to pity) he was slain upon the tomb of their two true servants, which they caused to be made for them with royal expenses and notable workmanship to preserve their dead lives. For his wicked servant, he should have felt the like or worse, but that his heart brake even to death with the beholding the honour done to their dead carcasses. There might Pyrocles quietly have enjoyed that crown by all the desire of that people, most of whom had revolted unto him; but he, finding a sister of the late king’s, (a fair and well esteemed lady) looking for nothing more than to be oppressed with her brother’s ruins, gave her in marriage to the nobleman, his father’s old friend, and endowed with them the crown of that kingdom. And not content with those public actions of princely and, as it were, governing virtue, they did, in that kingdom and some other near about, divers acts of particular trials, more famous because more perilous. For in that time those regions were full both of cruel monsters and monstrous men, all which in short time by private combats they delivered the countries of.
   ‘Among the rest, two brothers of huge both greatness and force, therefore commonly called giants, who kept themselves in a castle seated upon the top of a rock, impregnable because there was no coming unto it but by one narrow path where one man's force was able to keep down an army. These brothers had a while served the king of Pontus, and in all his affairs (especially of war whereunto they were only apt) they had showed as unconquered courage, so a rude faithfulness, being men indeed by nature apter to the faults of rage than of deceit; not greatly ambitious more than to be well and uprightly dealt with; rather impatient of injury than delighted with more than ordinary courtesies; and in injuries more sensible of smart or loss than of reproach or disgrace. These men being of this nature (and certainly jewels to a wise man, considering what indeed wonders they were able to perform) yet were discarded by that unworthy prince, after many notable deserts, as not worthy the holding; which was the more evident to them because it suddenly fell from an excess of favour which (many examples having taught them) never stopped his race till it came to an headlong overthrow.
   ‘They full of rage, retired themselves unto this castle: where thinking nothing juster than revenge, nor more noble than the effects of anger (that, according to the nature full of inward bravery and fierceness, scarcely in the glass of reason thinking itself fair but when it is terrible) they immediately gave themselves to make all the country about them (subject to that king) to smart for their lord’s folly, not caring how innocent they were, but rather thinking the more innocent they were, the more it testified their spite which they desired to manifest. And with use of evil growing more and more evil, they took delight in slaughter, and pleased themselves in making others’ wrack the effect of their pow er; so that where in the time that they obeyed a master, their anger was a serviceable power of the mind to do public good, so now, unbridled and blind judge of itself, it made wickedness violent, and praised itself in excellency of mischief almost to the ruin of the country, not greatly regarded by their careless and loveless king. Till now these princes, finding them so fleshed in cruelty as not to be reclaimed, secretly undertook the matter alone, for accompanied they would not have suffered them to have mounted; and so those great fellows scornfully receiving them as foolish birds fallen into their net, it pleased the eternal justice to make them suffer death by their hands: and so they were manifoldly acknowledged the savers of that country.
   ‘It were the part of a very idle orator to set forth the numbers of well-devised honours done unto them: but as high honour is not only gotten and born by pain and danger, but must be nursed by the like or else vanisheth as soon as it appears to the world, so the natural hunger thereof which was in Pyrocles suffered him not to account a resting seat of that which ever either riseth or falleth, but still to make one occasion beget another, whereby his doings might send his praise to others’ mouths to rebound again true contentment to his spirit. And therefore having well established those kingdoms under good governors, and rid them by their valour of such giants and monsters as before-time armies were not able to subdue, they determined in unknown order to see more of the world, and to employ those gifts, esteemed rare in them, to the good of mankind; and therefore would themselves (understanding that the king Euarchus was passed all the cumber of his wars) go privately to seek exercises of their virtue, thinking it not so worthy to be brought to heroical effects by fortune or necessity, like Ulysses and Aeneas, as by one’s own choice and working. And so went they away from very unwilling people to leave them, making time haste itself to be a circumstance of their honour, and one place witness to another of the truth of their doings. For scarcely were they out of the confines of Pontus, but that as they rode alone armed - for alone they went, one serving the other - they met an adventure, which though not so notable for any great effect they performed, yet worthy to be remembered for the unused examples therein as well of true natural goodness as of wretched ungratefulness.
   CHAPTER 10
   ‘It was in the kingdom of Galatia, the season being, as in the depth of winter, very cold and as then suddenly grown to so extreme and foul a storm that never any winter, I think, brought forth a fouler child; so that the princes were even compelled by the hail that the pride of the wind blew into their faces to seek some shrouding place, which a certain hollow rock offering unto them, they made it their shield against the tempest’s fury. And so staying there till the violence thereof was passed, they heard the speech of a couple who, not perceiving them, being hid within that rude canopy, held a strange and pitiful disputation, which made them step out, yet in such sort as they might see unseen. There they perceived an aged man and a young, scarcely come to the age of a man, both poorly arrayed, extremely weather-beaten; the old man blind, and the young man leading him; and yet through all those miseries, in both there seemed to appear a kind of nobleness not suitable to that affliction. But the first words they heard were these of the old man.
   ‘ “Well Leonatus,” said he, "since I cannot persuade thee to lead me to that which should end my grief and thy trouble, let me now entreat thee to leave me. Fear not; my misery cannot be greater than it is, and nothing doth become me but misery. Fear not the danger of my blind steps, I cannot fall worse than I am. And do not, I pray thee, do not obstinately continue to infect thee with my wretchedness, but fly, fly from this region only worthy of me."
   "Dear father,” answered he, "do not take away from me the only remnant of my happiness. While I have power to do you service, I am not wholly miserable.”
   ‘ “Ah, my son,” said he, and with that he groaned as if sorrow strave to break his heart, "how evil fits it me to have such a son, and how much doth thy kindness upbraid my wickedness!”
   These doleful speeches and some others to like purpose (well showing they had not been bom to the fortune they were in) moved the princes to go out unto them and ask the younger what they were.
   ‘ “Sirs,” answered he with a good grace, and made the more agreeable by a certain noble kind of piteousness, "I see well you are strangers that know not our misery, so well here known that, no man dare know but that we must be miserable. Indeed our state is such as though nothing is so needful unto us as pity, yet nothing is more dangerous unto us than to make ourselves so known as may stir pity. But your presence promiseth that cruelty shall not over-run hate; and if it did, in truth our state is sunk below the degree of fear.
   ‘ "This old man whom I lead was lately rightful prince of this country of Paphlagonia, by the hard-hearted ungratefulness of a son of his deprived not only of his kingdom (whereof no foreign forces were ever able to spoil him) but of his sight, the riches which Nature grants to the poorest creatures: whereby and by other his unnatural dealings, he hath been driven to such grief as even now he would have had me to have led him to the top of this rock, thence to cast himself headlong to death; and so would have made me, who received my life of him, to be the worker of his destruction. But noble gentlemen,” said he, “if either of you have a father and feel what dutiful affection is engraffed in a son's heart, let me entreat you to convey this afflicted prince to some place of rest and security. Amongst your worthy acts it shall be none of the least that a king of such might and fame, and so unjustly oppressed, is in any sort by you relieved.”
   ‘But before they could make him answer, his father began to speak: “Ah, my son,” said he, “how evil an historian are you that leave out the chief knot of all the discourse, my wickedness, my wickedness! And if thou dost it to spare my ears (the only sense now left me proper for knowledge) assure thyself thou dost mistake me. And I take witness of that sun which you see,” - with that he cast up his blind eyes as if he would hunt for light — "and wish myself in worse case than I do wish myself (which is as evil as may be) if I speak untruly, that nothing is so welcome to my thoughts as the publishing of my shame. Therefore know you, gentlemen (to whom from my heart I wish that it may not prove some ominous foretoken of misfortune to have met with such a miser as I am) that whatsoever my son (O God, that truth binds me to reproach him with the name of my son) hath said is true. But besides those truths,' this also is true, that having had in lawful marriage, of a mother fit to bear royal children, this son (such a one as partly you see and better shall know by my short declaration) and so enjoyed the expectations in the world of him till he was grown to justify their expectations (so as I needed envy no father for the chief comfort of mortality, to leave another oneself after me) I was carried by a bastard son of mine (if at least I be bound to believe the words of that base woman my concubine, his mother) first to mislike, then to hate, lastly to destroy, or to do my best to destroy this son (I think you think) undeserving destruction. What ways he used to bring me to it, if I should tell you, I should tediously trouble you with as much poisonous hypocrisy, desperate fraud, smooth malice, hidden ambition and smiling envy as in any living person could be harboured. But I list it not: no remembrance of naughtiness delights me but mine own; and methinks, the accusing his traps might in some manner excuse my fault, which certainly I loath to do. But the conclusion is that I gave order to some servants of mine, whom I thought as apt for such charities as myself, to lead him out into a forest and there to kill him.
   ‘ "But those thieves, better natured to my son than myself, spared his life, letting him go to learn to live poorly; which he did, giving himself to be a private soldier in a country hereby. But as he was ready to be greatly advanced for some noble pieces of service which he did, he heard news of me, who, drunk in my affection to that unlawful and unnatural son of mine, suffered myself so to be governed by him that all favours and punishments passed by him, all offices and places of importance distributed to his favourites; so that ere I was av/are, I had left myself nothing but the name of a king. Which he shortly weary of, too, with many indignities - if anything may be called an indignity which was laid upon me - threw me out of my seat and put out my eyes, and then, proud in his tyranny, let me go, neither imprisoning nor killing me, but rather delighting to make me feel my misery: misery indeed, if ever there were any; full of wretchedness, fuller of disgrace, and fullest of guiltiness. And as he came to the crown by so unjust means, as unjustly he kept it by force of stronger soldiers in citadels, the nests of tyranny and murderers of liberty; disarming all his own countrymen, that no man durst show himself a well-wilier of mine - to say the truth, I think, few of them being so, considering my cruel folly to my good son and foolish kindness to my unkind bastard. But if there were any who fell to pity of so great a fall, and had yet any sparks of unstained duty left in them towards me, yet durst they not show it scarcely with giving me alms at their doors, which yet was the only sustenance of my distressed life, nobody daring to show so much charity as to lend me a hand to guide my dark steps.
   ‘ ‘Till this son of mine (God knows, worthy of a more virtuous and more fortunate father) forgetting my abominable wrongs, not recking danger, and neglecting the present good way he was in of doing himself good, came hither to do this kind office you see him perform towards me; to my unspeakable grief, not only because his kindness is a glass (even to my blind eyes) of my naughtiness, but that above all griefs, it grieves me he should desperately adventure the loss of his well-deserving life for mine that yet owe more to fortune for my deserts, as if he would carry mud in a chest of crystal. For well I know, he that now reigneth, how much soever and with good reason he despiseth me, of all men despised, yet he will not let slip any advantage to make away with him whose ju£t title, ennobled by courage and goodness, may one day shake the seat of a never secure tyranny. And for this cause I craved of him to lead me to the top of this rock, indeed I must confess, with meaning to free him from so serpentine a companion as I am. But he, finding what I purposed, only therein since he was bom showed himself disobedient unto me. And now, gentlemen, you have the true story, which I pray you publish to the world, that my mischievous proceedings may be the glory of his filial piety, the only reward now left for so great a merit. And if it may be, let me obtain that of you which my son denies me: for never was there more pity in saving any than in ending me, both because therein my agonies shall end, and so shall you preserve this excellent young man, who else wilfully follows his own ruin.”
   ‘The matter in itself lamentable, lamentably expressed by the old prince (which needed not take to himself the gestures of pity since his face could not put off the marks thereof) greatly moved the two princes to compassion, which could not stay in such hearts as theirs without seeking remedy. But by and by the occasion was presented: for Plexirtus (so was the bastard called) came thither with forty horse only of purpose to murder his brother, of whose coming he had soon advertisement, and thought no eyes of sufficient credit in such a matter but his own, and therefore came himself to be actor and spectator. And as soon as he came, not regarding the weak (as he thought) guard but of two men, commanded some of his followers to set their hands to his in the killing of Leonatus. But the young prince, though not otherwise armed but with a sword, how falsely soever he was dealt with by others, would not betray himself, but bravely drawing it out, made the death of the first that assailed him warn his fellows to come more warily after him. But then Pyrocles and Musidorus were quickly become parties, so just a defence deserving as much as old friendship, and so did behave them among that company (more injurious than valiant) that many of them lost their lives for their wicked master.
   ‘Yet perhaps had the number of them at last prevailed if the king of Pontus (lately by them made so) had not come unlooked for to their succour: who (having had a dream which had fixed his imagination vehemently upon some great danger presently to follow those two princes whom he most dearly loved) was come in all haste, following as well as he could their track with a hundred horses in that country, which he thought (considering who then reigned) a fit place enough to make the stage of any tragedy.
   ‘But then the match had been so ill made for Plexirtus that his ill-led life and worse-gotten honour should have tumbled together to destruction, had there not come in Tydeus and Telenor with forty or fifty in their suite, to the defence of Plexirtus. These two were brothers, of the noblest house of that country, brought up from their infancy with Plexirtus; men of such prowess as not to know fear in themselves and yet to teach it others that should deal with them; for they had often made their lives triumph over most terrible dangers, never dismayed, and ever fortunate; and truly no more settled in valour than disposed to goodness and justice, if either they had lighted on a better friend or could have learned to make friendship a child and not the father of virtue. But bringing up rather than choice having first knit their minds unto him (indeed crafty enough either to hide his faults, or never to show them but when they might pay home) they willingly held out the course rather to satisfy him than all the world, and rather to be good friends than good men: so as though they did not like the evil he did, yet they liked him that did the evil; and though not counsellors of the offence, yet protectors of the offender. Now they, having heard of this sudden going out with so small a company in a country full of evil-wishing minds towards him (though they knew not the cause) followed him, till they found him in such case as they were to venture their lives or else he to lose his: which they did with such force of mind and body that truly I may justly say, Pyrocles and Musidorus had never till then found any that could make them so well repeat their hardest lesson in the feats of arms. And briefly so they did that if they overcame not, yet were they not overcome, but carried away that ungrateful master of theirs to a place of security, howsoever the princes laboured to the contrary. But this matter being thus far begun, it became not the constancy of the princes so to leave it; but in all haste making forces both in Pontus and Phrygia, they had in few days left him but only that one strong place where he was. For fear having been the only knot that had fastened his people unto him, that once untied by a greater force, they all scattered from him like so many birds whose cage had been broken.
   ‘In which season the blind king (having in the chief city of his realm set the crown upon his son Leonatus’ head) with many tears both of joy and sorrow setting forth to the whole people his own faults and his son’s virtue, after he had kissed him and forced his son to accept honour of him, as of his new-become subject, even in a moment died, as it should seem, his heart broken with unkindness and affliction, stretched so far beyond his limits with this excess of comfort as it was able no longer to keep safe his vital spirits. But the new king, having no less lovingly performed all duties to him dead than-alive, pursued on the siege of his unnatural brother, as much for the revenge of his father as for the establishing of his own quiet In which siege truly I cannot but acknowledge the prowess of those two brothers, than whom the princes never found in all their travel two of greater ability to perform, nor of abler skill for conduct.
   ‘But Plexirtus, finding that if nothing else, famine would at last bring him to destruction, thought better by humbleness to creep where by pride he could not march. For certainly so had Nature formed him, and the exercise of craft conformed him to all turningness of sleights that, though no man had less goodness in his soul than he, no man could better find the places whence arguments might grow of goodness to another; though no man felt less pity, no man could tell better how to stir pity; no man more impudent to deny, where proofs were not manifest; no man more ready to confess with a repenting manner of aggravating his own evil, where denial would but make the fault fouller. Now he took this way, that having gotten a passport for one (that pretends he would put Plexirtus alive into his hands) to speak with the kingis brother, he himself (though much against the minds of the valiant brothers, who rather wished to die in brave defence) with a rope about his neck, bare-footed, came to offer himself to the discretion of Leonatus. Where what submission he used, how cunningly in making greater the fault he made the faultiness the less, how artificially he could set out the torments of his own conscience with the burdensome cumber he had found of his ambitious desires, how finely seeming to desire nothing but death as ashamed to live, he begged life in the refusing it, I am not cunning enough to be able to express. But so fell out of it that though at first sight Leonatus saw him with no other eye than as the murderer of his father, and anger already began to paint revenge in many colours; ere long he had not only gotten pity but pardon, and if not an excuse of the fault past, yet an opinion of a future amendment: while the poor villains (chief ministers of his wickedness, now betrayed by the author thereof) were delivered to many cruel sorts of death; he so handling it that it rather seemed he had more come into the defence of an unremediable mischief already committed than that they had done it at first by his consent.
   ‘In such sort the princes left these reconciled brothers (Plexirtus in all his behaviour carrying him infar lower degreeof service than the ever-noble nature of Leonatus would suffer him) and taking likewise their leaves of their good friend the king of Pontus, who returned to enjoy their benefit, both of his wife and kingdom, they privately went thence, having only with them the two valiant brothers who would needs accompany them through divers places, they four doing acts more dangerous though less famous, because they were but private chivalries. Till hearing of the fair and virtuous queen Erona of Lycia besieged by the puissant king of Armenia, they bent themselves to her succour, both because the weaker (and weaker as being a lady) and partly because they heard the king of Armenia had in his company three of the most famous men living, for matters of arms, that were known to be in the world: whereof one was the prince Plangus whose name was sweetened by your breath, peerless lady, when the last day it pleased you to mention him unto me. The other two were two great princes (though holding of him) Barzanes and Euardes, men of giant-like both hugeness and force, in which two especially the trust the king had of victory was reposed. And of them, those brothers Tydeus and Telenor, sufficient judges in warlike matters, spake so high commendations that the two princes had even a youthful longing to have some trial of their virtue. And therefore as soon as they were entered into Lycia, they joined themselves with them that faithfully served the poor queen at that time besieged; and ere long animated in such sort their almost overthrown hearts, that they went by force to relieve the town, though they were deprived of a great part of their strength by the parting of the two brothers (who were sent for in all haste to return to their old friend and master Plexirtus) who, willingly hoodwinking themselves from seeing his faults, and binding themselves to believe what he said, often abused the virtue of courage to defend his foul vice of injustice. But now they were sent for to advance a conquest he was about, while Pyrocles and Musidorus pursued the delivery of the queen Erona.’
   CHAPTER 11
   ‘I have heard,’ said Pamela, ‘that part of the story of Plangus when he passed through this country: therefore you may, if you list, pass over that war of Erona’s quarrel lest, if you speak too much of war matters, you should wake Mopsa, which might haply breed a great broil.’
   He looked, and saw that Mopsa indeed sat swallowing of sleep with open mouth, making such a noise withal as nobody could lay the stealing of a nap to her charge. Whereupon, willing to use that occcasion, he kneeled down, and with humble heartedness and hearty earnestness printed in his graces:
   ‘Alas,’ said he, ‘divine lady, who have wrought such miracles in me as to make a prince (none of the basest) to think all principalities base in respect of the sheephook which may hold him up in your sight; vouchsafe now at last to hear in direct words my humble suit, while this dragon sleeps that keeps the golden fruit If in my desire I wish, or in my hopes aspire, or in my imagination feign to myself anything which may be the least spot to that heavenly virtue which shines in all your doings, I pray the eternal powers that the words I speak may be deadly poisons while they are in my mouth, and that all my hopes, all my desires, all my imaginations may only work their own confusion. But if love, love of you, love of your virtues, seek only that favour of you which becometh that gratefulness which cannot misbecome your excellency, O do not - ’
   He would have said further, but Pamela calling aloud, ‘Mopsa', she suddenly start up, staggering; and rubbing her eyes, ran first out of the door and then back to them, before she knew how she went out or why she came in again: till at length, being fully come to her little self, she asked Pamela why she had called her.
   ‘For nothing,’ said Pamela, ‘but that you might hear some tales of your servant’s telling: and therefore now,’ said she, ‘Dorus, go on.'
   But as he (who found no so good sacrifice as obedience) was returning to the story of himself, Philoclea came in, and by and by after her, Miso, so as for that time they were fain to let Dorus depart. But Pamela, delighted even to preserve in her memory the words of so well a beloved speaker, repeated the whole substance to her sister; till their sober dinner being come and gone, to recreate themselves something (even tired with the noisomeness of Miso’s conversation) they determined to go, while the heat of the day lasted, to bathe themselves (such being the manner of the Arcadian nymphs often to do) in the river of Ladon, and take with them a lute, meaning to delight them under some shadow. But they could not stir but that Miso with her daughter Mopsa was after them: and as it lay in their way to pass by the other lodge, Zelmane out of her window espied them and so stale down after them, which she might the better do because that Gynecia was sick, and Basilius (that day being his birth-day) according to his manner was busy about his devotions; and therefore she went after, hoping to find some time to speak with Philoclea. But not a word could she begin but that Miso would be one of the audience, so that she was driven to recommend thinking, speaking, and all, to her eyes, who diligently performed her trust, till they came to the river's side, which of all the rivers of Greece had the prize for excellent pureness and sweetness, insomuch as the very bathing in it was accounted exceeding healthful. It ran upon so fine and delicate a ground as one could not easily judge whether the river did more wash the gravel or the gravel did purify the river; the river not running forth right but almost continually winding, as if the lower streams would return to their spring, or that the river had a delight to play with itself. The banks of either side seeming arms of the loving earth that fain would embrace it, and the river a wanton nymph which still would slip from it; either side of the bank being fringed with most beautiful trees, which resisted the sun’s darts from over-much piercing the natural coldness of the river. There was the [sweete willow whose lovely bowes gave shade] .. 
   But among the rest a goodly cypress, who bowing her fair head over the water, it seemed she looked into it, and dressed her green locks by that running river.
   There the princesses determining to bathe themselves, though it was so privileged a place upon pain of death as nobody durst presume to come thither, yet for the more surety they looked round about, and could see nothing but a water-spaniel, who came down die river showing that he hunted for a duck, and with a snuffling grace disdaining that his smelling force could not as well prevail through the water as through the air; and therefore waiting with his eye to see whether he could espy the ducks getting up again, but then a little below them failing of his purpose, he got out of the river, and shaking off the water (as great men do their friends) now he had no further cause to use it, inweeded himself so as the ladies lost the further marking his sportfulness. And inviting Zelmane also to wash herself with them, and she excusing herself with having taken a late cold, they began by piece-meal to take away the eclipsing of their apparel.
   Zelmane would have put to her helping hand, but she was taken with such a quivering that she thought it more wisdom to lean herself to a tree and look on, while Miso and Mopsa, like a couple of foreswat melters, were getting the pure silver of their bodies out of the ure of their garments. But as the raiments went off to receive kisses of the ground, Zelmane envied the happiness of all, but of the smock was even jealous; and when that was taken away too, and that Philoclea remained - for her Zelmane only marked - like a diamond taken from out of the rock, or rather like the sun getting from under a cloud and showing his naked beams to the full view, then was the beauty too much for a patient sight, the delight too strong for a stayed conceit, so that Zelmane could not choose but run to touch, embrace and kiss her. But conscience made her come to herself and leave Philoclea who, blushing and withal smiling, making shamefulness pleasant and pleasure shamefaced, tenderly moved her feet, unwonted to feel the naked ground, till the touch of the cold water made a pretty kind of shrugging come over her body, like the twinkling of the fairest among the fixed stars. But the river itself gave way unto her, so that she was straight breast high, which was the deepest that thereabout she could be: and when cold Ladon had once fully embraced them, himself was no more so cold to those ladies, but as if his cold complexion had been heated with love, so seemed he to play about every part he could touch.
   'Ah sweet, now sweetest Ladon,’ said Zelmane, ‘why dost thou not stay thy course to have more full taste of thy happiness? But the reason is manifest: the upper streams make such haste to have their part of embracing that the nether, though loathly, must needs give place unto them. O happy Ladon, within whom she is, upon whom her beauty falls, through whom her eye pierceth: O happy Ladon which art now an imperfect mirror of all perfection, canst thou ever forget the blessedness of this impression? If thou do, then let thy bed be turned from fine gravel to weeds and mud. If thou do, let some unjust niggards make weirs to spoil thy beauty. If thou do, let some greater river fall into thee to take away the name of Ladon. O Ladon, happy Ladon, rather slide than run by her, lest thou should’st make her legs slip from her; and then, O happy Ladon, who would then call thee but the most cursed Ladon?'
   But as the ladies played them in the water, sometimes striking it with their hands, the water (making lines in his face) seemed to smile at such beating, and with twenty bubbles, not to be content to have the picture of their face in large upon him, but he would in each of these bubbles set forth the miniature of them.
   But Zelmane, whose sight was gain-said by nothing but the transparent veil of Ladon (like a chamber where a great fire is kept, though the fire be at one stay, yet with the continuance continually hath his heat increased) had the coals of her affection so kindled with wonder and blown with delight that now all her parts grudged that her eyes should do more homage than they to the princess of them. Insomuch that taking up the lute, her wit began to be with a divine fury inspired; her voice would in so beloved an occasion second her wit; her hands accorded the lute’s music to the voice; her panting heart danced to the music; while I think her feet did beat the time, while her body was the room where it should be celebrated, her soul the queen which should be delighted. And so together went the utterance and the invention that one might judge it was Philoclea’s beauty which did speedily write it in her eyes, or the sense thereof which did word by word indite it in her mind, whereto she (but as an organ) did only lend utterance. The song was to this purpose: 
What tongue can her perfections tell,
In whose each part all pens may dwell?
Her hair fine threads of finest gold,
In curled knots man’s thought to hold:
But that her forehead says, ‘In me 
A whiter beauty you may see’;
Whiter indeed, more white than snow,
Which on cold winter's face doth grow.
That doth present those even brows 
Whose equal line their angles bows,
Like to the moon when after change 
Her homed head abroad doth range;
And arches be to heavenly lids,
Whose wink each bold attempt forbids.
For the black stars those spheres contain,
The matchless pair, even praise doth stain.
No lamp whose light by art is got,
No sun which shines, and seeth not,
Can liken them without all peer,
Save one as much as other clear:
Which only thus unhappy be,
Because themselves they cannot see.
Her cheeks with kindly claret spread,
Aurora-like new out of bed;
Or like the fresh queen-apple’s side,
Blushing at sight of Phoebus’ pride.
Her nose, her chin pure ivory wears:
No purer than the pretty ears.
So that therein appears some blood,
Like wine and milk that mingled stood:
In whose incirclets if ye gaze,
Your eyes may tread a lover’s maze.
But with such turns the voice to stray,
No talk untaught can find the way.
The tip no jewel needs to wear;
The tip is jewel of the ear.
But who those ruddy lips can miss,
Which blessed still themselves do kiss?
Rubies, cherries, and roses new,
In worth, in taste, in perfit hue:
Which never part, but that they show 
Of precious pearl the double row,
The second sweetly-fenced ward,
Her heavenly-dewed tongue to guard,
Whence never word in vain did flow.
Fair under these doth stately grow 
The handle of this precious work,
The neck in which strange graces link.
Such be, I think, the sumptuous towers 
Which skill doth make in princes’ bowers.
So good a say invites the eye 
A little downward to espy
The lovely clusters of her breasts,
Of Venus’ babe the wanton nests:
Like pommels round of marble clear,
Where azur’d veins well mix’d appear,
With dearest tops of porphyry.
Betwixt these two a way doth he,
A way more worthy beauty’s fame,
Than that which bears the milken name.
This leads into the joyous field,
Which only still doth lilies yield;
But lilies such whose native smell 
The Indian odours doth excel.
Waist it is called, for it doth waste 
Men's lives, until it be imbraced.
There may one see, and yet not see 
Her ribs in white all armed be,
More white than Neptune’s foamy face,
When struggling rocks he would embrace.
In those delights the wand’ring thought 
Might of each side astray be brought,
But that her navel doth unite,
In curious circle, busy sight,
A dainty seal of virgin-wax,
Where nothing but impression lacks.
Her belly then glad sight doth fill,
Justly entitled Cupid’s hill:
A hill most fit for such a master,
A spotless mine of alabaster,
Like alabaster fair and sleek,
But soft and supple, satin-like.
In that sweet seat the boy doth sport:
Loth, I must leave his chief resort.
For such a use the world hath gotten,
The best things still must be forgotten.
Yet never shall my song omit 
Her thighs, for Ovid’s song more fit;
Which flanked with two sugared flanks,
Lift up their stately swelling banks,
That Albion cliffs in whiteness pass;
With haunches smooth as looking-glass.
But bow all knees, now of her knees 
My tongue doth tell what fancy sees.
The knots of joy, the gins of love,
Whose motion makes all graces move;
Whose bought incaved doth yield such sight 
Like cunning painter shadowing white. 
The gartring place with child-like sign 
Shows easy print in metal fine.
But then again the flesh doth rise 
In her brave calves, like crystal skies,
Whose Atlas is a smallest small,
More white than whitest bone of whale.
Thereout steals out that round clean foot,
This noble cedar’s precious root:
In show and scent pale violets,
Whose step on earth all beauty sets.
But back unto her back, my Muse,
Where Leda’s swan his feathers mews, 
Along whose ridge such bones are met,
Like comfits round in marchpane set 
Her shoulders be like two white doves,
Perching within square royal roofs,
Which leaded are with silver skin, 
Passing the hate-spot ermelin.
And thence those arms derived are;
The Phoenix wings are not so rare 
For faultless length, and stainless hue.
Ah woe is me, my woes renew.
Now course doth lead me to her hand,
Of my first love the fatal band;
Where whiteness doth for ever sit:
Nature herself enamell’d it
For there with strange compact doth he 
Warm snow, moist pearl, soft ivory.
There fall those sapphire-coloured brooks,
Which conduit-like with curious crooks,
Sweet islands make in that sweet land.
As for the fingers of the hand,
The bloody shafts of Cupid's war,
With amatists they headed are.
Thus hath each part his beauty’s part:
But how the Graces do impart 
To all her limbs a special grace,
Becoming every time and place,
Which doth even beavty beautify,
And most bewitch the wretched eye;
How all this is but a fair inn 
Of fairer guests, which dwell within.
Of whose high praise, and praiseful bliss,
Goodness the pen, Heaven paper is,
The ink immortal fame doth lend.
As I began, so must I end.
No tongue can her perfections tell,
In whose each part all pens may dwell.
   But as Zelmane was coming to the latter end of her song, she might see the same water-spaniel, which before had hunted, come and fetch away one of Philoclea's gloves, whose fine proportion showed well what a dainty guest was wont there to be lodged. It was a delight to Zelmane to see that the dog was therewith delighted, and so let him go a little way withal, who quickly carried it out of sight among certain trees and bushes which were very close together. But by and by he came again, and amongst the raiments - Miso and Mopsa being preparing sheets against their coming out — the dog lighted upon a httle book of four or five leaves of paper and was bearing that away too. But then Zelmane (not knowing what importance it might be of) ran after the dog, who going straight to those bushes, she might see the dog deliver it to a gentleman who secretly lay there. But she hastily coming in, the gentleman rose up, and with a courteous though sad countenance presented himself unto her. Zelmane’s eyes straight willed her mind to mark him, for she thought in her life she had never seen a man of a more goodly presence, in whom strong making took not away delicacy, nor beauty fierceness; being indeed such a right man-like man as Nature, often erring, yet shows she would fain make. But when she had a while, not without admiration, viewed him, she desired him to deliver back the glove and paper because they were the lady Philoclea’s, telling him withal that she would not willingly let them know of his close lying in that prohibited place while they were bathing themselves, because she knew they would be mortally offended withal.
   'Fair lady,' answered he, 'the worst of the complaint is already passed, since I feel of my fault in myself the punishment. But for these things, I assure you, it was my dog’s wanton boldness, not my presumption.’ With that he gave her back the paper: 'But for the glove,’ said he, ‘since it is my lady Philoclea’s, give me leave to keep it, since my heart cannot persuade itself to part from it. And I pray you tell the lady (lady indeed of all my desires) that owns it, that I will direct my life to honour this glove with serving her.'
   ‘O villain,’ cried out Zelmane, maddened with finding an unlooked-for rival, and that he would make her a messenger. ‘Dispatch,’ said she, 'and deliver it, or by the life of her that owns it, I will make thy soul (though too base a price) pay for it’: and with that drew out her sword, which, Amazon-like, she ever ware about her.
   The gentleman retired himself into an open place from among the bushes, and then drawing out his too, he offered to deliver it unto her, saying, withal, 'God forbid I should use my sword against you, since, if I be not deceived, you are the same famous Amazon that both defended my lady’s just title of beauty against the valiant Phalantus, and saved her life in killing the lion. Therefore I am rather to kiss your hands, with acknowledging myself bound to obey you.’
   But this courtesy was worse than a bastinado to Zelmane; so that again with rageful eyes she bade him defend himself, for no less than his life should answer it.
   ‘A hard case,’ said he, ‘to teach my sword that lesson, which hath ever used to turn itself to a shield in a lady’s presence.’
   But Zelmane, hearkening to no more words, began with such witty fury to pursue him with blows and thrusts, that nature and virtue commanded the gentleman to look to his safety. Yet still courtesy, that seemed incorporate in his heart, would not be persuaded by danger to offer any offence, but only to stand upon the best defensive guard he could; sometimes going back, being content in that respect to take on the figure of cowardice; sometimes with strong and well-met wards, sometimes cunning avoidings of his body, and sometimes feigning some blows which himself pull'd back before they needed to be withstood. And so with play did he a good while fight against the fight of Zelmane who (more spited with that courtesy, that one that did nothing should be able to resist her) burned away with choler any motions which might grow out of her own sweet disposition, determining to kill him if he fought no better; and so redoubling her blows, drave the stranger to no other shift than to wafd and go back, at that time seeming the image of innocency against violence. But at length he found that both in public and private respects, who stands only upon defence stands upon no defence: for Zelmane seeming to strike at his head, and he going to ward it withal stepped back as he was accustomed, she stopped her blow in the air, and suddenly turning the point, ran full at his breast so as he was driven with the pommel of his sword (having no other weapon of defence) to beat it down: but the thrust was so strong that he could not so wholly beat it away but that it met with his thigh, through which it ran.
   But Zelmane retiring her sword and seeing his blood, victorious anger was conquered by the before-conquered pity; and heartily sorry, and even ashamed with herself she was, considering how little he had done who well she found could have done more. Insomuch that she said, Truly I am sorry for your hurt, but yourself gave the cause, both in refusing to deliver the glove, and yet not fighting as I know you could have done. But,' said she, because I perceive you disdain to fight with a woman, it may be before a year come about, you shall meet with a near kinsman of mine, Pyrocles prince of Macedon, and I give you my word, he for me shall maintain this quarrel against you.'
   ‘I would,’ answered Amphialus, ‘I had many more such hurts, to meet and know that worthy prince, whose virtue I love and admire, though my good destiny hath not been to see his person.’
   But as they were so speaking, the young ladies came, to whom Mopsa (curious in anything but her own good behaviour) having followed and seen Zelmane fighting, had cried what she had seen, while they were drying themselves, and the water, with some drops, seemed to weep that it should part from such bodies. But they careful of Zelmane (assuring themselves that any Arcadian would bear reverence to them) Pamela with a noble mind and Philoclea with a loving (hastily hiding the beauties whereof Nature was p/oud and they ashamed) they made quick work to come to save Zelmane. But already they found them in talk, and Zelmane careful of his wound. But when they saw him, they knew it was their cousin-german, the famous Amphialus, whom yet with a sweet graced bitterness they blamed for breaking their father’s commandment, especially while themselves were in such sort retired. But he craved pardon, protesting unto them that he had only been to seek solitary places, by an extreme melancholy that had a good while possessed him; and guided to that place by his spaniel, where, while the dog hunted in the river, he had withdrawn himself to pacify with sleep his over watched eyes, till a dream waked him, and made him see that whereof he had dreamed; and withal not obscurely signified that he felt the smart of his own doings. But Philoclea, that was even jealous of herself for Zelmane, would needs have her glove, and not without so mighty a lour as that face could yield.
   As for Zelmane when she knew it was Amphialus, ‘Lord Amphialus/ said she, ‘I have long desired to know you, heretofore, I must confess, with more goodwill, but still with honouring your virtue, though I love not your person: and at this time, I pray you, let us take care of your wound, upon condition you shall hereafter promise that a more knightly combat shall be performed between us.’
   Amphialus answered in honourable sort, but with such excusing himself that more and more accused his love to Philoclea and provoked more hate in Zelmane. But Mopsa had already called certain shepherds not far off, who knew and well observed their limits, to come and help to carry away Amphialus, whose wound suffered him not without danger to strain it: and so he leaving himself with them, departed from them, faster bleeding in his heart than at his wound, which, bound up by the sheets wherewith Philoclea had been wrapped, made him thank the wound and bless the sword for that favour.
   CHAPTER 12
   He being gone, the ladies (with merry anger talking in what naked simplicity their cousin had seen them) returned to the lodge-ward; yet thinking it too early (as long as they had any day) to break off so pleasing a company with going to perform a cumbersome obedience, Zelmane invited them to the little arbour only reserved for her, which they willingly did: and there sitting, Pamela having a while made the lute in his language show how glad it was to be touched by her fingers, Zelmane delivered up the paper which Amphialus had at first yielded unto her; and seeing wrritten upon the backside of it 'The complaint of Plangus’, remembering what Dorus had told her, and desiring to know how much Philoclea knew of her estate, she took occasion in the presenting of it to ask whether it were any secret or no.
   ‘No truly,’ answered Philoclea, ‘it is but even an exercise of my father’s writing, upon this occasion: he was one day, somewhile before your coming hither, walking abroad, having us two with him, almost a mile hence; and crossing a highway which comes from the city of Megalopolis, he saw this gentleman whose name is there written, one of the properest and best-graced men that ever I saw, being of middle age and of a mean stature. He lay as then under a tree, while his servants were getting fresh post- horses for him. It might seem he was tired with the extreme travel he had taken, and yet not so tired that he forced to take any rest, so hasty he was upon his journey; and withal so sorrowful that the very face thereof was painted in his face, which with pitiful motions, even groans, tears, and passionate talking to himself, moved my father to fall in talk with him: who at first not knowing him, answered him in such a desperate phrase of grief that my father afterwards took a delight to set it down in such a form as you see: which if you read, what you doubt of my sister and I are able to declare unto you. Zelmane willingly opened the leaves and read it, being written dialogue-wise in this manner.
   PLANGUS  BASILIUS

PLANGUS: Alas, how long this pilgrimage doth last!
       What greater ills have now the heavens in store,
       To couple coming harms with sorrows past?
Long since my voice is hoarse, and throat is sore,
       With cries to skies, and curses to the ground,
       But more I plain, I feel my woes the more.
Ah, where was first that cruel cunning found,
       To frame of earth a vessel of the mind,
       Where it should be to self-destruction bound?
What needed so high sprites such mansions blind?
       Or wrapped in flesh, what do they here obtain 
       But glorious name of wretched human kind?
Balls to the stars, and thralls to Fortune’s reign;
       Turn’d from themselves, infected with their cage,
       Where death is fear’d, and life is held with pain;
Like players plac’d to fill a filthy stage,
       Where change of thoughts one fool to other shows,
       And all but jests, save only sorrow’s rage.
The child feels that; the man that feeling knows,
       With cries first bom, the presage of his life,
       Where wit but serves to have true taste of woes.
A shop of shame, a book where blots be rife 
       This body is: this body so composed,
       As in itself to nourish mortal strife.
So divers be the elements disposed
       In this weak work, that it can never be 
       Made-uniform to any state reposed.
Grief only makes his wretched state to see
       (Even like a top which nought but whipping moves)
       This man, this talking beast, this walking tree.
Grief is the stone which finest judgement proves.
       For who grieves not hath but a blockish brain.
       Since cause of grief no cause from life removes.

BASILIUS: How long wilt thou with moanful music stain 
       The cheerful notes these pleasant places yield,
       Where all good haps a perfect state maintain?

PLANGUS: Cursed be good haps, and cursed be they that build 
       Their hopes on haps, and do not make despair 
       For all these certain blows the surest shield.
Shall I that saw Erona’s shining hair
       Torn with her hands, and those same hands of snow 
       With loss of purest blood themselves to tear;
Shall I that saw those breasts, where beauties flow,
       Swelling with sighs, made pale with mind’s disease,
       And saw those eyes, those suns, such showers to show;
Shall I, whose ears her mournful words did seize,
       Her words in syrup laid of sweetest breath,
       Relent those thoughts which then did so displease?
No, no. Despair my daily lesson saith,
       And saith, although I seek my life to fly,
       Plangus must live to see Erona’s death.
Plangus must live some help for her to try
       (Though in despair) for Love so forceth me;
       Plangus doth live, and shall Erona die?
Erona die? O heaven (if heaven there be)
       Hath all thy whirling course so small effect?
       Serve all thy starry eyes this shame to see?
Let dolts in haste some altars fair erect
       To those high powers, which idly sit above,
       And virtue do in greatest need neglect.

BASILIUS: O man, take heed how thou the gods do move 
       To cause-ful wrath, which thou canst not resist. 
       Blasphemous words the speaker vain do prove.
Alas, while we are wrapped in foggy mist 
       Of our self love (so passions do deceive)
       We think they hurt, when most they do assist.
To harm us worms should that high Justice leave 
       His nature? Nay, himself? For so it is.
       What glory from our loss can he receive?
But still our dazzled eyes their way do miss.
       While that we do at his sweet scourge repine,
       The kindly way to beat us on to bliss.
If she must die then hath she passed the line
       Of loathsome days, whose loss how canst thou moan, 
       That dost so well their miseries define?
But such we are with inward tempest blown 
       Of winds quite contrary in waves of will:
       We moan that lost, which had, we did bemoan.

PLANGUS: And shall she die? Shall cruel fire spill 
       Those beams that set so many hearts on fire?
       Hath she not force even death with love to kill?
Nay, even cold Death inflam’d with hot desire 
       Her to enjoy, where joy itself is thrall,
       Will spoil the earth of his most rich attire.
Thus Death becomes a rival to us all,
       And hopes with foul embracements her to get,
       In whose decay Virtue’s fair shrine must fall.
O Virtue weak, shall Death his triumph set
       Upon thy spoils, which never should lie waste?
       Let Death first die; be thou his worthy let.
By what eclipse shall that sun be defac’d?
       What mine hath erst thrown down so fair a tower? 
       What sacrilege hath such a saint disgrac’d?
The world the garden is, she is the flower
       That sweetens all the place; she is the guest 
       Of rarest price, both heaven and earth her bower.
And shall, O me, all this in ashes rest?
       Alas if you a Phoenix new will have
       Burnt by the sun, she first must build her nest.
But well you know, the gentle sun would save
       Such beams so like his own, w'hich might have might 
       In him the thoughts of Phaeton’s dam to grave.
Therefore, alas, you use vile Vulcan's spite,
       Which nothing spares, to melt that virgin wax, 
       Which while it is, it is all Asia’s light.
O Mars, for what doth serve thy armed axe?
       To let that wittol beast consume in flames 
       Thy Venus child, whose beauty Venus lacks?
O Venus, if her praise no envy frames
       In thy high mind, get her thy husband's grace.
       Sweet speaking oft a currish heart reclaims.
O eyes of mine, where once she saw her face,
       Her face which was more lively in my heart;
       O brain, where thought of her hath only place;
O hand, which touch’d her hand when we did part;
       O lips that kiss’d that hand with my tears sprent;
       O tongue, then dumb, not daring tell my smart;
O soul, whose love in her is only spent,
       What ere you see, think, touch, kiss, speak, or love,
       Let all for her, and unto her be bent

BASILIUS: Thy wailing words do much my spirits move, 
       They uttered are in such a feeling fashion,
       That sorrow’s work against my will I prove.
Methinks I am partaker of thy passion,
       And in thy case do glass mine own debility:
       Self-guilty folk most prone to feel compassion.
Yet reason saith, ‘Reason should have ability
       To hold these worldly things in such proportion,
       As let them come or go with even facility.’
But our desire’s tyrannical extortion
       Doth force us there to set our chief delightfulness
       Where but a baiting place is all our portion.
But still, although we fail of perfect rightfulness,
       Seek we to tame these childish superfluities:
       Let us not wink though void of purest sightfulness.
For what can breed more peevish incongruities
       Than man to yield to female lamentations?
       Let us some grammar learn of more congruities.

PLANGUS: If through mine ears pierce any consolations,
       By wise discourse, sweet tunes, or poets’ fiction;
       If aught I cease these hideous exclamations,
While that my soul, she, she lives in affliction;
       Then let my life long time on earth maintained be,
       To wretched me, the last worst malediction.
Can I, that know her sacred parts restrained be
       From any joy, know fortune’s vile displacing her,
       In moral rules let raging woes contained be? 
Can I forget, when they in prison placing her,
       With swelling heart in spite and due disdainfulness 
       She lay for dead, till I help’d with unlacing her?
Can I forget from how much mourning plainfulness
       With diamond in window-glass she graved 
       ‘Erona die, and end this ugly painfulness’?
Can I forget in how strange phrase she craved
       That quickly they would her bum, drown or smother,
       As if by death she only might be saved?
Then let me eke forget one hand from other:
       Let me forget that Plangus I am called:
       Let me forget I am son to my mother:
But if my memory must thus be thralled
       To that strange stroke which conquer’d all my senses,
       Can thoughts still thinking so rest unappalled?

BASILIUS: Who still doth seek against himself offences,
       What pardon can avail? Or who employs him 
       To hurt himself, what shields can be defences?
Woe to poor man; each outward thing annoys him 
       In divers kinds; yet as he were not filled,
       He heaps in inward grief, that most destroys him.
Thus is our thought with pain for thistles tilled:
       Thus be our noblest parts dried up with sorrow:
       Thus is our mind with too much minding spilled.
One day lays up stuff of grief for the morrow:
       And whose good haps do leave him -unprovided,
       Condoling cause of friendship he will borrow. 
Betwixt the good and shade of good divided,
       We pity deem that which but weakness is:
       So are we from our high creation slided.
But Plangus, lest I may your sickness miss,
       Or rubbing, hurt the sore, I here do end.
   The ass did hurt when he did think to kiss.
   When Zelmane had read it over, marvelling very much of the speech of Erona’s death, and therefore desirous to know further of it, but more desirous to hear Philoclea speak, ‘Most excellent lady/ said she, ‘one may be little the wiser for reading this dialogue, since it neither sets forth what this Plangus is, nor what Erona is, nor what the cause should be which threatens her with death and him with sorrow. Therefore I would humbly crave to understand the particular discourse thereof because, I must confess, something in my travel I have heard of this strange matter, which I would be glad to find by so sweet an authority confirmed.’
   ‘The truth is/ answered Philoclea, ‘that after he knew my father to be prince of this country, while he hoped to prevail something with him in a great request he made unto him, he was content to open fully the estate both of himself and of that lady; which with my sister’s help/ said she, ‘who remembers it better than I, I will declare unto you. And first of Erona (being the chief subject of this discourse) this story (with more tears and exclamations than I list to spend about it) he recounted.’
   CHAPTER 13
   Of late there reigned a king in Lycia who had, for the blessing of his marriage, this only daughter of his, Erona; a princess worthy, for her beauty, as much praise as beauty may be praise-worthy. This princess Erona, being nineteen years of age, seeing the country of Lycia so much devoted to Cupid as that in every place his naked pictures and images were superstitiously adored (either moved thereunto by the esteeming that could be no god-head which could breed wickedness, or the shamefast consideration of such nakedness) procured so much of her father as utterly to pull down and deface all those statues and pictures: which how terribly he punished - for to that the Lycians impute it - quickly after appeared.
   ‘For she had not lived a year longer, when she was stricken with most obstinate love to a young man but of mean parentage in her father’s court named Antiphilus: so mean as that he was but the son of her nurse, and by that means (without other desert) became known of her. Now so evil could she conceal her fire and so wilfully persevered she in it, that her father offering her the marriage of the great Tiridates, king of Armenia, who desired her more than the joys of heaven, she for Antiphilus’ sake refused it. Many ways her father sought to withdraw her from it: sometimes persuasions, sometimes threatenings; once, hiding Antiphilus, and giving her to understand that he was fled the country; lastly, making a solemn execution to be done of another under the name of Antiphilus, whom he kept in prison. But neither she liked persuasions, nor feared threatenings, nor changed for absence: and when she thought him dead, she sought all means, as well by poison as knife, to send her soul, at least, to be married in the eternal church with him. This so brake the tender father’s heart that, leaving things as he found them, he shortly after died. Then forthwith Erona, being seized of the crown, and arming her will with authority, sought to advance her affection to the holy title of matrimony.
   ‘But before she could accomplish all the solemnities, she was overtaken with a war the King Tiridates made upon her only for her person, towards whom, for her ruin, love had kindled his cruel heart - indeed cruel and tyrannous. For being far too strong in the field, he spared not man, w'oman and child; but (as though there could be found no foil to set forth the extremity of his love but extremity of hatred) wrote, as it were, the sonnets of his love in the blood, and tuned them in the cries of her subjects - although his fair sister Artaxia, who would accompany him in the army, sought all means to appease his fury: till lastly, he besieged Erona in her best city, vowing to win her or lose his life. And now had he brought her to the point either of a woeful consent or a ruinous denial, when there came thither (following the course which virtue and fortune led them) two excellent young princes, Pyrocles and Musidorus, the one prince of Macedon, the other of Thessalia: two princes as Plangus said (and he witnessed his saying with sighs and tears) the most accomplished both in body and mind that the sun ever looked upon.’
   While Philoclea spake those words, ‘O sweet words’, thought Zelmane to herself, “which are not only a praise to me, but a praise to praise itself, which out of that mouth issueth.'
   ‘Those two princes,’ said Philoclea, ‘as well to help the weaker (especially being a lady) as to save' a Greek people from being ruined by such whom we call and count barbarous, gathering together such of the honestest Lycians as would venture their hves to succour their princess, giving order by a secret message they sent into the city that they should issue with all force at an appointed time, they set upon Tiridates’ camp with so well guided a fierceness that being of both sides assaulted, he was like to be overthrown, but that this Plangus (being general of Tiridates' horsemen) especially aided by the two mighty men, Euardes and Barzanes, rescued the footmen, even almost defeated: but yet could not bar the princes (with their succours both of men and victual) to enter the city.
   ‘Which when Tiridates found would make the war long (which length seemed to him worse than a languishing consumption) he made a challenge of three princes in his retinue against those two princes and Antiphilus: and that thereupon the quarrel should be decided, with compact that neither side should help his fellow, but of whose side the more overcame, with him the victory should remain. Antiphilus (though Erona chose rather to bide the brunt of war than venture him) yet could not for shame refuse the offer, especially since the two strangers that had no interest in it did willingly accept it; besides that he saw it like enough that the people (weary of the miseries of war) would rather give him up, if they saw him shrink, than for his sake venture their ruin, considering that the challengers were of far greater worthiness than himself. So it was agreed upon; and against Pyrocles was Euardes king of Bithynia; Barzanes of Hircania against Musidorus - two men that thought the world scarce able to resist them; and against Antiphilus he placed this same Plangus, being his own cousin german and son to the king of Iberia. Now so it fell out that Musidorus slew Barzanes, and Pyrocles Euardes, which victory those princes esteemed above all that ever they had: but of the other side Plangus took Antiphilus prisoner; under which colour (as if the matter had been equal, though indeed it was not, the greater part being overcome of his side) Tiridates continued his war; and to bring Erona to a compelled yielding, sent her word that he would the third morrow after, before the walls of the town, strike off Antiphilus’ head, without his suit in that space were granted; adding, withal, because he had heard of her desperate affection, that if in the meantime she did herself any hurt, what tortures could be devised should be laid upon Antiphilus.
   'Then lo, if Cupid be a god, or that the tyranny of our own thoughts seem as a god unto us - but whatsoever it was, then it did set forth the miserableness of his effects, she being drawn to two contraries by one cause. For the love of him commapded her to yield to no other: the love of him commanded her to preserve his life; which knot might well be cut, but untied it could not be. So that love in her passions, like a right make-bate, whispered to both sides arguments of quarrel.
   “What,” said he (of the one side) “dost thou love Antiphilus, O Erona, and shall Tiridates enjoy thy body? With what eyes wilt thou look upon Antiphilus when he shall know that another pos- sesseth thee? But if thou wilt do it, canst thou do it? Canst thou force thy heart? Think with thyself, if this man have thee, thou shalt never have more part of Antiphilus than if he were dead. But thus much more, that the affection shall be still gnawing, and the remorse still present Death perhaps will cool the rage of thy affection, where thus, thou shalt ever love, and ever lack. Think this beside: if thou marry Tiridates, Antiphilus is so excellent a man that long he cannot be from being in some high place married. Canst thou suffer that too? If another kill him, he doth him the wrong: if thou abuse thy body, thou dost him the wrong. His death is a work of nature, and either now or at another time he shall die. But it shall be thy work, thy shameful work, which is in thy power to shun, to make him live to see thy faith falsified and his bed defiled.”
   ‘But when love had well kindled that party of her thoughts, then went he to the other side. “What,” said he, “O Erona, and is thy love of Antiphi'us come to that point as thou dost now make it a question whether he shall die or no? O excellent affection which for too much love will see his head off! Mark well the reasons of the other side, and thou shalt see it is but love of thyself which so disputeth. Thou canst not abide Tiridates: this is but love of thyself. Thou shalt be ashamed to look upon him afterwards: this is but fear of shame and love of thyself. Thou shalt want him as much then: this is but love of thyself. He shall be married: if he be well, why should that grieve thee but for love of thyself? No, no, pronounce these words if thou canst, “Let Antiphilus die.” ’
   Then the images of each side stood before her understanding. One time she thought she saw Antiphilus dying; another time she thought Antiphilus saw her by Tiridates enjoyed: twenty times calling for a servant to carry message of yielding, but before he came the mind was altered. She blushed when she considered the effect of granting: she was pale when she remembered the fruits of denying. For weeping, sighing, wringing her hands and tearing her hair were indifferent of both sides. Easily she would have agreed to have broken all disputations with her own death, but that the fear of Antiphilus’ further torments stayed her. At length, even the evening before the day appointed of his death, the determination of yielding prevailed, especially growing upon a message of Antiphilus who with all the conjuring terms he could devise, besought her to save his life upon any conditions. But she had no sooner sent her messenger to Tiridates but her mind  changed, and she went to the two young princes, Pyrocles and Musidorus, and falling down at their feet, desired them to try some way for her deliverance, showing herself resolved not to over-live Antiphilus nor yet to yield to Tiridates.
   ‘They, that knew not what she had done in private, prepared that night accordingly; and as sometimes it falls out that what is inconstancy seems cunning, so did this change indeed Stand in as good stead as a witty dissimulation. For it made the king as reckless as them diligent, so that in the dead time of the night the princes issued out of the town, with whom she would needs go, either to die herself or rescue Antiphilus, having no armour nor weapon but affection. And I cannot tell you how, by what device, though Plangus at large described it; the conclusion was, the wonderful valour of the two princes so prevailed that Antiphilus was succoured and the king jlain. Plangus was then the chief man left in the camp; and therefore seeing no other remedy, conveyed in safety into her country Artaxia, now Queen of Armenia; who with true lamentations made known to the world that her new greatness did no way comfort her in respect of her brother's loss, whom she studied all means possible to revenge upon every one of the occasioners, having (as she thought) overthrown her brother by a most abominable treason. Insomuch that being at home, she proclaimed great rewards to any private man, and herself in marriage to any prince, that would destroy Pyrocles and Musidorus. But thus was Antiphilus redeemed and (though against the consent of all her nobility) married to Erona; in which case the two Greek princes, being called away by another adventure, left them.
   CHAPTER 14
   'But now, methinks, as I have read some poets who, when they intend to tell some horrible matter, they bid men shun the hearing of it, so if I do not desire you to stop your ears from me, yet may I well desire a breathing time before I am to tell the execrable treason of Antiphilus that brought her to this misery; and withal wish you all that from all mankind indeed you stop your ears. O most happy were we if we did set our loves one upon another.’ And as she spake that word, her cheeks in red letters writ more than her tongue did speak. And therefore since I have named Pkngus, I pray you, sister,’ said she, ‘help me with the rest, for I have held the stage long enough; and if it please you to make his fortune known, as I have done Erona’s, I will after take heart again to go on with his falsehood; and so between us both, my Lady Zelmane shall understand both the cause and parties of this lamentation.’
   ‘Nay, I beshrew me then,’ said Miso, ‘I will none of that, I promise you, as long as I have the government. I will first have my tale; and then, my Lady Pamela, my Lady Zelmane, and my daughter Mopsa’ (for Mopsa was then returned from Amphialus) ‘may draw cuts, and the shortest cut speak first. For I tell you, and this may be suffered, when you are married, you will have first and last word of your husbands.’
   The ladies laughed to see with what an eager earnestness she looked, having threatening not only in her ferret eyes, but while she spake her nose seeming to threaten her chin, and her shaking limbs one to threaten another. But there was no remedy, they must obey; and Miso, sitting on the ground with her knees up, and her hands upon her knees, timing her voice with many a quavering cough, thus discoursed unto them.
   ‘I tell you true,’ said she, ‘whatsoever you think of me, you will one day be as I am; and I, simple though I sit here, thought once my penny as good silver as some of you do: and if my father had not played the hasty fool (it is no he I tell you) I might have had another-gains husband than Dametas. But let that pass, God amend him; and yet I speak it not without good cause. You are full in your tittle-tattlings of Cupid: here is Cupid and there is Cupid. I will tell you now what a good old woman told me, what an old wise man told her, what a great learned clerk told him, and gave it him in writing; and here I have it in my prayer-book.’
   ‘I pray you,’ said Philoclea, ‘let us see it and read it.’
   ‘No haste but good,’ said Miso, ‘you shall first know how I came by it. I was a young girl of a seven and twenty years old, and I could not go through the street of our village but I might hear the young men talk: “O the pretty little eyes of Miso”: “O the fine thin lips of Miso”: “O the goodly fat hands of Miso”: besides, how well a certain wrying I had of my neck became me. Then the one would wink with one eye, and the other cast daisies at me. I must confess, seeing so many amorous, it made me set up my peacock’s tail with the highest Which when this good old woman perceived (O the good old woman; well may the bones rest of the good old woman) she called me to her into her house. I remember full well it stood in the lane as you go to the barber’s shop. All the town knew her; there was a great loss of her. She called me to her, and taking first a sop of wine to comfort her heart — it was of the same wine that comes out of Candia, which we pay so dear for now-a-days, and in that good world was very good cheap - she called me to her: “Minion,” said she (indeed I was a pretty one in those days, though I say it) “I see a number of lads that love you. Well,” said she, “I say no more; do you know what love is?” With that she brought me into a corner, where there was painted a foul fiend I trow, for he had a pair of horns like a bull, his feet cloven, as many eyes upon his body as my grey mare hath dapples, and for all the world so placed. This monster sat like a hangman upon a pair of gallows. In his right hand he was painted holding a crown of laurel, in his left hand a purse of money; and out of his mouth hung a lace of two fair pictures of a man and a woman, and such a countenance he showed as if he would persuade folks by those allurements to come thither and be hanged. I, like a tender-hearted wench, shrieked out for fear of the devil. "Well,” said she, “this same is even love: therefore do what thou list with all those fellows one after another, and it recks not much what they do to thee, so it be in secret; but upon my charge, never love none of them.” “Why mother,” said I, “could such a thing come from the belly of fair Venus?” — for a few days before, our priest (between him and me) had told me the whole story of Venus. “Tush,” said she, “they are all deceived”; and therewith gave me this book which she said a great maker of ballads had given to an old painter, who, for a little pleasure, had bestowed both book and picture of her. “Read there,” said she, “and thou shalt see that his mother was a cow, and the false Argus his father.” And so she gave me this book, and there now you may read it.’
   With that the remembrance of the good old woman made her make such a face to weep as, if it were not sorrow, it was the carcass of sorrow that appeared there. But while her tears came out, like rain falling upon dirty furrows, the latter end of her prayer-book was read among these ladies, which contained this:
Poor Painters oft with silly Poets join,
To fill the world with strange but vain conceits:
One brings the stuff, the other stamps the coin,
Which breeds nought else but glosses of deceits. 
       Thus painters Cupid paint, thus poets do,
       A naked god, blind, young, with arrows two.

Is he a god that ever flies the light?
Or naked he, disguis’d in all untruth?
If he be blind, how hitteth he so right?
How is he young that tam’d old Phoebus’ youth?
       But arrows two, and tipped with gold or lead?
       Some hurt, accuse a third with homy head.®

No, nothing so; an old false knave he is,
By Argus got on Io, then a cow: 
What time for her Juno her Jove did miss,
And charge of her to Argus did allow.
       Mercury kill’d his false sire for this act,
       His dam, a beast, was pardon’d beastly fact.

With father’s death and mother's guilty shame,
With Jove’s disdain at such a rival’s seed;
The wretch compell’d a runagate became,
And learn’d what ill a miser-state doth breed:
       To lie, to steal, to pry, and to accuse,
       Nought in himself, each other to abuse.

Yet bears he still his parents’ stately gifts,
A horned head, cloven feet, and thousand eyes,
Some gazing still, some winking wily shifts,
With long large ears, where never rumour dies.
       His horned head doth seem the heaven to spite;
       His cloven foot doth never tread aright.

Thus half a man, with man he daily haunts,
Cloth’d in the shape which soonest may deceive:
Thus half a beast, each beastly vice he plants,
In those weak hearts that his advice receive.
       He prowls each place still in new colours decked,
       Sucking one’s ill, another to infect.

To narrow breasts, he comes all wrapped in gain:
To swelling hearts, he shines in honour’s fire:
To open eyes, all beauties he doth rain;
Creeping to each with flattering of desire.
       But for that love is worst which rules the eyes,
       Thereon his name, there his chief triumph lies.

Millions of years this old drivel Cupid lives,
While still more wretch, more wicked he doth prove.
Till now at length that Jove him office gives,
(At Juno’s suit, who much did Argus love)
       In this our world a hangman for to be 
       Of all those fools that will have all they see.
   The ladies made sport at the description and story of Cupid. But Zelmane could scarce suffer those blasphemies (as she took them) to be read, but humbly besought Pamela she would perform her sister’s request of the other part of the story.
   ‘Noble lady,’ answered she, beautifying her face with a sweet smiling, and the sweetness of her smiling with the beauty of her face, ‘since I am bom a prince’s daughter, let me not give example of disobedience. My governess will have us draw cuts, and therefore I pray you let us do so: and so perhaps it will light upon you to entertain this company with some story of your own; and it is reason our ears should be willinger to hear, as your tongue is abler to deliver.’
   ‘I will think,’ answered Zelmane, ‘excellent princess, my tongue of some value if it can procure your tongue thus much to favour me.’
   But Pamela pleasantly persisting to have fortune their judge, they set their hands, and Mopsa (though at first for squeamishness going up and down with her head like a boat in a storm) put to her golden gols among them, and blind fortune (that saw not the colour of them) gave her the pre-eminence: and so being her time to speak (wiping her mouth, as there was good cause) she thus tumbled into her matter.
   ‘In time past,’ said she, ‘there was a king, the mightiest man in all his country, that had by his wife the fairest daughter that ever did eat pap. Now this king did keep a great house, that everybody might come and take their meat freely. So one day, as his daughter was sitting in her window, playing upon a harp, as sweet as any rose, and combing her head with a comb all of precious stones,there came in a knight into the court upon a goodly horse, one hair of gold, and the other of silver; and so the knight casting up his eyes to the window did fall into such love with her that he grew not worth the bread he eat; till many a sorry day going over his head, with Daily Diligence and Grisly Groans he won her affection, so that they agreed to run away together. And so in May, when all true hearts rejoice, they stale out of the castle without staying so much as for their breakfast. Now forsooth, as they went together, often all to-kissing one another, the knight told her he was brought up among the water-nymphs, who had so bewitched him that if he were ever ask’d his name, he must presently vanish away; and therefore charged her upon his blessing, that she never ask him what he was nor whither he would. And so a great while she kept his commandment; till once, passing through a cruel wilderness as dark as pitch, her mouth so watered that she could not choose but ask him the question. And then he, making the griev- ousest complaints that would have melted a tree to have heard them, vanish’d quite away, and she lay down, casting forth as pitiful cries as any screech-owl. But having lain so, wet by the rain and burnt by the sun, five days and five nights, she gat up and went over many a high hill and many a deep river, till she came to an aunt’s house of hers, and came and cried to her for help; and she for pity gave her a nut, and bade her never open her nut till she was come to the extremest misery that ever tongue could speak of. And so she went, and she went, and never rested the evening where she went in the morning, till she came to a second aunt, and she gave her another nut.’
   ‘Now good Mopsa,’ said the sweet Philoclea,  pray thee at my request keep this tale till my marriage-day, and I promise thee that the best gown I wear that day shall be thine.’ Mopsa was very glad of the bargain, especially that it should grow a festival tale: so that Zelmane - who desired to find the uttermost what these ladies understood touching herself, and having understood the danger of Erona (of which before she had never heard) purposing with herself (as soon as this pursuit she now was in was brought to any effect) to succour her - entreated again that she might know as well the story of Plangus as of Erona. Philoclea referred it to her sister’s perfecter remembrance, who with so sweet a voice and so winning a grace as in themselves were of most forcible eloquence to procure attention, in this manner to their earnest request soon condescended.
   
   CHAPTER 15 
   ‘The father of this prince Plangus as yet lives and is king of Iberia: a man (if the judgement of Plangus may be accepted) of no wicked nature, nor willingly doing evil, without himself mistake the evil seeing it disguised under some form of goodness. This prince being married at the first to a princess (who both from her ancestors and in herself was worthy of him) by her had this son, Plangus. Not long after whose birth, the queen, as though she had performed the message for which she was sent into the world, returned again unto her maker. The king, sealing up all thoughts of love under the image of her memory, remained a widower many years after, recompensing the grief of that disjoining from her in conjoining in himself both a fatherly and a motherly care towards her only child Plangus, who being grown to man’s age, as our own eyes may judge, could not but fertilely requite his father's fatherly education.
   ‘This prince (while yet the errors in his nature were excused by the greenness of his youth which took all the fault upon itself) loved a private man’s wife of the principal city of that kingdom - if that may be called love, which he rather did take into himself willingly than by which he was taken forcibly. It sufficeth that the young man persuaded himself he loved her, she being a woman beautiful enough, if it be possible that the only outside can justly entitle a beauty. But finding such a chase as only fled to be caught, the young prince brought his affection with her to that point which ought to engrave remorse in her heart and to paint shame upon her face. And so possessed he his desire without any interruption, he constantly favouring her, and she thinking that the enamelling of a prince’s name might hide the spots of a broken wedlock. But as I have seen one that was sick of a sleeping disease could not be made wake but with pinching of him, so out of his sinful sleep his mind, unworthy so to be lost, was not to be called to itself but by a sharp accident
   ‘It fell out that his many-times leaving of the court in undue times began to be noted, and (as prince’s ears be manifold) from one to another came unto the king; who, careful of his only son, sought and found by his spies (the necessary evil servants to a king) what it was whereby he was from his better delights so diverted. Whereupon the king, to give his fault the greater blow, used such means by disguising himself that he found them (her husband being absent) in her house together, which he did to make him the more feelingly ashamed of it. And that way he took, laying threatenings upon her, and upon him reproaches. But the poor young prince (deceived with that young opinion that if it be ever lawful to he, it is for one's lover) employed all his wit to bring his father to a better opinion. And because he might bend him from that - as he counted it - crooked conceit of her, he wrested him, as much as he could possibly, to the other side, not sticking with prodigal protestations to set forth her chastity; not denying his own attempt, but thereby the more extolling her virtue. His sophistry prevailed, his father believed, and so believed, that ere long, though he were already stepped into the winter of his ge, he found himself warm in those desires which were in his son far more excusable. To be short, he gave himself over unto it and, because he would avoid the odious comparison of a young rival, sent away his son with an army to the subduing of a province lately rebelled against him, which he knew could not be a less work than of three or four years. Wherein he behaved him so worthily as even to this country the fame thereof came long before his own coming; while yet his father had a speedier success, but in a far unnobler conquest. For while Plangus was away, the old man, growing only in age and affection, followed his suit with all means of unhonest servants, large promises, and each thing else that might help to countervail his own unloveliness.
   ‘And she, whose husband about that time died, forgetting the absent Plangus, or at least not hoping of him to obtain so aspiring a purpose, left no art unused which might keep the line from breaking whereat the fish was already taken, not drawing him violently, but letting him play himself upon the hook which he had so greedily swallowed. For, accompanying her mourning garments with a doleful countenance, yet neither forgetting handsomeness in her mourning garments nor sweetness in her doleful countenance, her words were ever seasoned with sighs, and any favour she showed, bathed in tears, that affection might see cause of pity, and pity might persuade cause of affection. And being grown skilful in his humours, she was no less skilful in applying his humours; never suffering his fear to fall to a despair, nor his hope to hasten to an assurance. She was content he should think that she loved him, and a certain stolen look should sometimes (as though it were against her will) betray it: but if thereupon he grew bold, he straight was encountered with a mask of virtue. And that which seemeth most impossible unto me (for as near as I can I repeat it as Plangus told it) she could not only sigh when she would, as all can do, and weep when she would, as, they say, some can do; but, being most impudent in her heart, she could, when she would, teach her cheeks blushing, and make a shamefastness the cloak of shamelessness.
   ‘In sum, to leave out many particularities which he recited, she did not only use so the spur that his desire ran on, but so the bit, that it ran on even in such a career as she would have it; that within a while the king, seeing with no other eyes but such as she gave him, and thinking no other thoughts but such as she taught him; having at the first liberal measure of favours, then shortened of them when most his desire was inflamed, he saw no other way but marriage to satisfy his longing and her mind (as he thought) loving, but chastely loving. So that by the time Plangus returned from being notably victorious of the rebels, he found his father not only married but already a father of a son and daughter by this woman. Which though Plangus (as he had every way just cause) was grieved at, yet did his grief never bring forth either contemning of her or repining at his father. But she (who, besides she was grown a mother and a step-mother, did read in his eyes her own fault and made his conscience her guiltiness) thought still that his presence carried her condemnation; so much the more as that she, unchastely attempting his wonted fancies, found, for the reverence of his father’s bed, a bitter refusal: which breeding rather spite than shame in her, or if it were a shame, a shame not of the fault but of the repulse, she did not only (as hating him) thirst for a revenge, but (as fearing harm from him) endeavoured to do harm unto him.
   'Therefore did she try the uttermost of her wicked wit how to overthrow him in the foundation of his strength, which was in the favour of his father; which because she saw strong both in nature and desert, it required the more cunning how to undermine it. And therefore, shunning the ordinary trade of hireling sycophants, she made her praises of him to be accusations, and her advancing him to be his ruin. For first, with words nearer admiration than liking she would extol his excellencies, the goodliness of his shape, the power of his wit, the valiantness of his courage, the fortunateness of his successes, so as the father might find in her a singular love towards him: nay she shunned not to kindle some few sparks of jealousy in him. Thus having gotten an opinion in his father that she was far from meaning mischief to the son, then fell she to praise him with no less vehemency of affection, but with much more cunning of malice. For then she sets forth the liberty of his mind, the high flying of his thoughts, the fitness in him to bear rule, the singular love the subjects bear him, that it was doubtful whether his wit were greater in winning their favours or his courage in employing their favours; that he was not born to live a subject life, each action of his bearing in it majesty, such a kingly entertainment, such a kingly magnificence, such a kingly heart for enterprises; especially remembering those virtues which in a successor are no more honoured by the subjects than suspected of the princes. Then would she, by putting off objections, bring in objections to her husband’s head, already infected with suspicion.
   ‘ “Nay,” would she say, “I dare take it upon my death that he is no such son as many of like might have been, who loved greatness so well as to build their greatness upon their father’s ruin. Indeed ambition, like love; can abide no lingering, and ever urgeth on his own successes, hating nothing but what may stop them. But the gods forbid we should ever once dream of any such thing in him, who perhaps might be content that you and the world should know what he can do: but the more power he hath to hurt, the more admirable is his praise, that he will not hurt.”
   ‘Then ever remembering to strengthen the suspicion of his estate with private jealousy of her love, doing him excessive honour when he was in presence, and repeating his pretty speeches and graces in his absence; besides, causing him to be employed in all such dangerous matters as either he should perish in them, or (if he prevailed) they should increase his glory, which she made a weapon to wound him; until she found that suspicion began already to speak for itself, and that her husband’s ears were grown hungry of rumours, and his eyes prying into every accident.
   ‘Then took she help to her of a servant near about her husband, whom she knew to be of a hasty ambition, and such a one who, wanting true sufficiency to raise him, would make a ladder of any mischief. Him she useth to deal more plainly in alleging causes of jealousy, making him know the fittest times when her husband already was stirred that way. And so they two with divers ways nourished one humour, like musicians that, singing divers parts, make one music. He sometimes with fearful countenance would desire the king to look to himself, for that all the court and city were full of whisperings and expectation of some sudden change, upon what ground himself knew not. Another time he would counsel the king to make much of his son and hold his favour, for that it was too late now to keep him under. Now seeming to fear himself, because, he said, Plangus loved none of them that were great about his father. Lastly, breaking with him directly, making a sorrowful countenance and an humble gesture bear false witness for his true meaning, that he found not only soldiery but people weary of his government, and all their affections bent upon Plangus. Both he and the queen concurring in strange dreams, and each thing else that in a mind already perplexed might breed astonishment; so that within a while, all Plangus’ actions began to be translated into the language of suspicion. Which though Plangus found, yet could he not avoid, even contraries being driven to draw one yoke of argument If he were magnificent, he spent much with an aspiring intent: if he spared, he heaped much with an aspiring intent: if he spake courteously, he angled the people’s hearts: if he were silent, he mused upon some dangerous plot In sum, if he could have turned himself to as many forms as Proteus, every form should have been made hideous.
   ‘But so it fell out that a mere trifle gave them occasion of further proceeding. The king one morning going to a vineyard that lay along the hill whereupon his castle stood, he saw a vine-labourer that, finding a bough broken, took a branch of the same bough for want of another thing and tied it about the place broken. The king asking the fellow what he did, “Marry,” said he, “I make the son bind the father.” This word (finding the king already superstitious through suspicion) amazed him straight, as a presage of his own fortune; so that returning and breaking with his wife how much he misdoubted his estate, she made such gainsaying answers as while they strave, strave to be ovecome. But even while the doubts most boiled, she thus nourished them.
   ‘She under-hand dealt with the principal men of that country, that at the great parliament (which was then to be held) they should in the name of all the estates persuade the king (being now stepped deeply into old age) to make Plangus his associate in government with him, assuring them that not only she would join with them, but that the father himself would take it kindly; charging them not to acquaint Plangus withal, for that perhaps it might be harmful unto him if the king should find that he were a party. They (who thought they might do it not only willingly, because they loved him, and truly, because such indeed was the mind of the people, but safely, because she who ruled the king was agreed thereto) accomplished her counsel; she indeed keeping promise of vehement persuading the same; which the more she and they did, the more she knew her husband would fear, and hate the cause of his fear. Plangus found this, and humbly protested against such desire or will to accept. But the more he protested, the more his father thought he dissembled, accounting his integrity to be but a cunning face of falsehood: and therefore delaying the desire of his subjects, attended some fit occasion to lay hands upon his son, which his wife thus brought to pass.
   ‘She caused that same minister of hers to go unto Plangus and (enabling his words with great show of faith, and endearing them with desire of secrecy) to tell him that he found his ruin conspired by his stepmother with certain of the noblemen of that country, the king himself giving his consent, and that few days should pass before the putting it in practice; withal discovering the very truth indeed with what cunning his stepmother had proceeded. This, agreeing with Plangus’ his own opinion, made him give him the better credit; yet not so far as to fly out of his country (according to the naughty fellow’s persuasion) but to attend and to see further. Whereupon the fellow, by the direction of his mistress, told him one day that the same night, about one of the clock, the king had appointed to have his wife and those noblemen together to deliberate of their manner of proceeding against Plangus; and therefore offered him that if himself would agree, he would bring him into a place where he should hear all that passed, and so have the more reason both to himself and to the world to seek his safety. The poor Plangus, being subject to that only disadvantage of honest hearts, credulity, was persuaded by him; and arming himself, because of his late going, was closely conveyed into the place appointed. In the meantime, his stepmother making all her gestures cunningly counterfeit a miserable affliction, she lay almost grovelling on the floor of her chamber, not suffering anybody to comfort her; until they calling for her husband, and he held off with long inquiry, at length she told him (even almost crying out every word) that she was weary of her life, since she was brought to that plunge either to conceal her husband’s murder or accuse her son, who had ever been more dear than a son unto her. Then with many interruptions and exclamations she told him that her son Plangus, soliciting her in the old affection between them, had besought her to put her helping hand to the death of the king, assuring her that, though all the laws in the world were against it, he would marry her when he were king.
   ‘She had not fully said thus much, with many pitiful digressions, when in comes the same fellow that brought Plangus; and running himself out of breath, fell at the king’s feet, beseeching him to save himself for that there was a man with a sword drawn in the next room. The king, affrighted, went out and called his guard, who entering the place, found indeed Plangus with his sword in his hand, but not naked, yet standing suspiciously enough to one already suspicious. The king, thinking he had put up his sword because of the noise, never took leisure to hear his answer, but made him prisoner, meaning the next morning to put him to death in the market-place.
   'But the day had no sooner opened the eyes and ears of his friends and followers but that there was a little army of them who came and by force delivered him, although numbers on the other side, abused with the fine framing of their report, took arms for the king. But Plangus, though he might have used the force of his friends to revenge his wrong and get the crown, yet the natural love of his father, and hate to make their suspicion seem just, caused him rather to choose a voluntary exile than to make his father’s death the purchase of his life: and therefore went he to Tiridates, whose mother was his father’s sister, living in his court eleven or twelve years, ever hoping by his intercession and his own desert to recover his father's grace. At the end of which time, the war of Erona happened, which my sister with the cause thereof discoursed unto you.
   ‘But his father had so deeply engraved the suspicion in his heart that he thought his flight rather to proceed of a fearful guiltiness than of an humble faithfulness, and therefore continued his hate with such vehemency that he did even hate his nephew Tiridates, and afterwards his niece Artaxia, because in their court he received countenance, leaving no means unattempted of destroying his son; among other, employing that wicked servant of his, who undertook to empoison him. But his cunning disguised him not so well but that the watchful servants of Plangus did discover him. Whereupon the wretch was taken and, before his well-deserved execution, by torture forced to confess the particularities of this, which in general I have told you.
   ‘Which confession authentically set down, though Tiridates with solemn embassage sent it to the king, wrought no effect. For the king, having put the reins of the government into his wife's hand, never did so much as read it, but sent it straight by her to be considered, so as they rather heaped more hatred upon Plangus for the death of their servant. And now finding that his absence and their reports had much diminished the wavering people's affection towards Plangus, with advancing fit persons for faction, and grantirg great immunities to the commons, they prevailed so far as to cause the son of the second wife, called Palladius, to be proclaimed successor, and Plangus quite excluded: so that Plangus was driven to continue his serving Tiridates, as he did in the war against Erona, and brought home Artaxia, as my sister told you; when Erona by the treason of Antiphilus - '
   But at that word she stopped. For Basilius, not able longer to abide their absence, came suddenly among them and with smiling countenance, telling Zelmane he was afraid she had stolen away his daughters, invited them to follow the sun’s counsel in going then to their lodging, for indeed the sun was ready to set They yielded, Zelmane meaning some other time to understand the story of Antiphilus' treason and Erona’s danger, whose cause she greatly tendered. But Miso had no sooner espied Basilius but that as spitefully as her rotten voice could utter it she set forth the sauciness of Amphialus. But Basilius only attended what Zelmane's opinion was, who though she hated Amphialus, yet the nobility of her courage prevailed over it, and she desired he might be pardoned that youthful error, considering the reputation he had to be one of the best knights in the world, so as hereafter he governed himself as one remembering his fault Basilius, giving the infinite terms of praises to Zelmane's both valour in conquering and pitifulness in pardoning, commanded no more words to be made of it, since such he thought was her pleasure.
   
   
   CHAPTER 16
   So brought he them up to visit his wife, where, between her and him, the poor Zelmane received a tedious entertainment oppressed with being loved almost as much as with loving. Basilius, not so wise in covering his passion, could make his tongue go almost no other pace but to run into those immoderate praises which the foolish lover thinks short of his mistress, though they reach far beyond the heavens. But Gynecia, whom womanly modesty did more outwardly bridle, yet did oftentimes use the advantage of her sex in kissing Zelmane as she sat upon her bed-side by her, which was but still more and more sweet incense to cast upon the fire wherein her heart was sacrificed. Once Zelmane could not stir but that (as if they had been poppets, whose motion stood only upon her pleasure) Basilius with serviceable steps, Gynecia with greedy eyes, would follow her. Basilius’ mind Gynecia well knew, and could have found in her heart to laugh at, if mirth could have borne any proportion with her fortune. But all Gynecia's actions were interpreted by Basilius as proceeding from jealousy of his amorousness. Zelmane betwixt both, like the poor child whose father, while he beats him, will make him believe it is for love; or like the sick man, to whom the physician swears the ill-tasting wallowish medicine he proffers is of a good taste. Their love was hateful, their courtesy troublesome, their presence cause of her absence thence where not only her light but her life consisted. ‘Alas/ thought she to herself, ‘dear Dorus, what odds is there between thy destiny and mine? For thou hast to do in thy pursuit but with shepherdish folks, who trouble thee with a little envious care and affected diligence; but I (besides that I have now Miso, the worst of thy devils, let loose upon me) am waited on by princes, and watched by the two wakeful eyes of love and jealousy. Alas, incomparable Philoclea, thou ever seest me, but dost never see me as I am. Thou hearest willingly all that I dare say, and I dare not say that which were most fit for thee to hear. Alas, who ever but I was imprisoned in liberty, and banished being still present? To whom but me have lovers been jailors, and honour a captivity?’
   But the night coining on with her silent steps upon them, they parted each from other (if at least they could be parted of whom every one did live in another) and went about to flatter sleep with their beds, that disdained to bestow itself liberally upon such eyes which by their will would ever be looking: and in least measure upon Gynecia, who (when Basilius after long tossing was gotten asleep, and the cheerful comfort of the lights removed from her) kneeling up in her bed, began with a soft voice and swollen heart to renew the curses of her birth; and then in a manner embracing her bed:
   ‘Ah, chastest bed of mine/ said she, ‘which never heretofore could’st accuse me of one defiled thought, how canst thou now receive this disastered changeling? Happy, happy be they only which be not; and thy blessedness only in this respect thou mayest feel that thou hast no feeling.’ With that she furiously tare off great part of her fair hair: Take here, O forgotten virtue,’ said she, ‘this miserable sacrifice, while my soul was clothed with modesty, that was a comely ornament: now why should nature crown that head which is so wicked, as her only despair is she cannot be enough wicked?’
   More she would have said but that Basilius, awaked with the noise, took her in his arms and began to comfort her, the good man thinking it was all for a jealous love of him; which humour if she would a little have maintained, perchance it might have weakened his new-conceived fancies. But he, finding her answers wandering from the purpose, left her to herself, glad the next morning to take the advantage of a sleep (which a little before day, overwatched with sorrow, her tears had as it were sealed up in her eyes) to have the more conference with Zelmane; who baited on this fashion by those two lovers, and ever kept from any mean to declare herself, found in herself a daily increase of her violent desires, like a river, the more swelling, the more his current is stopped.
   The chief recreation she could find in her anguish was sometime to visit that place where first she was so happy as to see the cause of her unhap. There would she kiss the ground and thank the trees, bless the air, and do dutiful reverence to everything that she thought did accompany her at their first meeting: then return again to her inward thoughts; sometimes despair darkening all her imaginations, sometimes the active passion of love cheering and clearing her invention how to unbar that cumbersome hindrance of her two ill-matched lovers. But this morning Basilius himself gave her good occasion to go beyond them. For having combed and tricked himself more curiously than any time forty winters before, coming where Zelmane was, he found her given over to her musical muses, to the great pleasure of the good old Basilius who retired himself behind a tree, while she with a most sweet voice did utter these passionate verses:
Loved I am, and yet complain of love:
As loving not, accus’d, in love I die.
When pity most I crave, I cruel prove:
Still seeking love, love found, as much I fly.
Burnt in myself, I muse at other’s fire;
What I call wrong, I do the same and more:
Barr’d of my will, I have beyond desire;
       I wail for want, and yet am chok'd with store.

This is thy work, thou god for ever blind:
Though thousands old, a boy entitled still.
Thus children do the silly birds they find 
With stroking hurt, and too much cramming kill.
   Yet thus much love, O love, I crave of thee:
   Let me be lov’d, or else not loved be.
   Basilius made no great haste from behind the tree, till he perceived she had fully ended her music. But then loth to lose the precious fruit of time, he presented himself unto her, falling down upon both his knees and holding up his hands, as the old governess of Danae is painted when she suddenly saw the golden shower, ‘O heavenly woman, or earthly goddess,’ said he, ‘let not my presence be odious unto you, nor my humble suit seem of small weight in your ears. Vouchsafe your eyes to descend upon this miserable old man, whose life hath hitherto been maintained but to serve as an increase of your beautiful triumphs. You only have overthrown me, and in my bondage consists my glory. Suffer not your own work to be despised of you, but look upon him with pity, whose life serves for your praise.’
   Zelmane, keeping a countenance askance as she understood him not, told him it became her evil to suffer such excessive reverence of him, but that it worse became her to correct him to whom she owed duty; that the opinion she had of his wisdom was such as made her esteem greatly of his words, but that the words themselves sounded so as she could not imagine what they might intend.
   ‘Intend?’ said Basilius, proud that that was brought in question, ‘What may they intend but a refreshing of my soul, and a swageing of my heat, and enjoying those your excellencies wherein my life is upheld and my death threatened?'
   Zelmane, lifting up her face as if she had received a mortal injury of him, ‘And is this the devotion your ceremonies have been bent unto?' said she: ‘Is it the disdain of my estate or the opinion of my lightness that have emboldened such base fancies towards me? "Enjoying,” quoth you! Now little joy come to them that yield to such enjoying.’
   Poor Basilius was so appalled that his legs bowed under him; his eyes looked as though he would gladly hide himself, and his old blood going to his heart, a general shaking all over his body possessed him. At length, with a wan mouth, he was about to give a stammering answer, when it came into Zelmane’s head by this device to make her profit of his folly; and therefore with a relented countenance thus said unto him, ‘Your words, mighty Prince, were unfit either for me to hear or you to speak, but yet the large testimony I see of your affection makes me willing to suppress a great number of errors. Only thus much I think good to say, that the same words in my lady Philoclea’s mouth, as from one woman to another, so as there were no other body by, might have had a better grace, and perchance have found a gentler receipt.’
   Basilius (whose senses by desire were held open and conceit was by love quickened) heard scarcely half her answer out but that, as if spieedy flight might save his life, he turned away and ran with all the speed his body would suffer him towards his daughter Philoclea, whom he found at that time dutifully watching by her mother, and Miso curiously watching her, having left Mopsa to do the like service to Pamela. Basilius forthwith calling Philoclea aside, with all the conjuring words which desire could indite and authority utter, besought her she would preserve his life in whom her life was begun, she would save his grey hairs from rebuke and his aged mind from despair; that if she were not cloyed with his company, and that she thought not the earth over-burdened with him, she would cool his fiery grief, which was to be done but by her breath: that in fine, whatsoever he was, he was nothing but what it pleased Zelmane, all the powers of his spirit depending of her; that if she continued cruel he could no more sustain his life than the earth remain fruitful in the sun’s continual absence. He concluded, she should in one payment requite all his deserts; and that she needed not disdain any service, though never so mean, which was warranted by the sacred name of a father.
   Philoclea, more glad than ever she had known herself that she might by this occasion enjoy the private conference of Zelmane, yet had so sweet a feeling of virtue in her mind that she would not suffer a vile colour to be cast over her fair thoughts, but with humble grace answered her father: that there needed neither promise nor persuasion to her to make her do her uttermost for her father's service; that for Zelmane’s favour, she would in all virtuous sort seek it towards him; and that as she would not pierce further into his meaning than himself should declare, so would she interpret all his doings to be accomplished in goodness: and therefore desired (if otherwise it were) that he would not impart it to her, who then should be forced to begin, by true obedience, a show of disobedience; rather performing his general commandment (which had ever been to embrace virtue) than any new particular sprung out of passion and contrary to the former.
   Basilius, content to take that since he could have no more, thinking it a great point, if, by her means, he could get but a more free access unto Zelmane, allowed her reasons and took her proffer thankfully, desiring only a speedy return of comfort Philoclea was parting, and Miso straight behind her, like Alecto following Proserpina. But Basilius forced her to stay though with much ado, she being sharp-set upon the fulfilling of a shrewd office in over-looking Philoclea; and so said to Basilius that she did as she was commanded, and could not answer it to Gynecia if she were any whit from Philoclea, telling him true that he did evil to take her charge from her. But Basilius, swearing he would put out her eyes if she stirred a foot to trouble his daughter, gave her a stop for that while.
   CHAPTER 17 
   So away departed Philoclea, with a new field of fancies for her travailing mind; for well she saw her father was grown her adverse party, and yet her fortune such as she must favour her rival; and the fortune of that fortune such, as neither that did hurt her nor any contrary mean help her.
   But she walked but a little on, before she saw Zelmane lying upon a bank, with her face so bent over Ladon that (her tears falling into the water) one might have thought that she began meltingly to be metamorphosed to the under-running river. But by and by with speech she made known as well that she lived as that she sorrowed:
   ‘Fair streams,’ said she, ‘that do vouchsafe in your clearness to represent unto me my blubbered face, let the tribute-offer of my tears unto you procure your stay a while with me, that I may begin yet at last to find something that pities me, and that all things of comfort and pleasure do not fly away from me. But if the violence of your spring command you to haste away to pay your duties to your great prince, the sea, yet carry with you these few words, and let the uttermost ends of the world know them. A love more clear than yourselves, dedicated to a love, I fear, more cold than yourselves, with the clearness lays a night of sorrow upon me, and with the coldness inflames a world of fire within me.'
   With that she took a willow stick and wrote in a sandy bank these few verses:
Over these brooks trusting to ease mine eyes,
       (Mine eyes even great in labour with their tears)
I laid my face; my face wherein there lies 
       Clusters of clouds, which no sun ever clears.
       In watery glass my watery eyes I see;
       Sorrows ill eas’d, where sorrows painted be.

My thoughts imprison’d in my secret woes,
       With flamy breaths do issue oft in sound:
The sound to this strange air no sooner goes,
       But that it doth with Echoes’ force rebound,
       And make me hear the plaints I would refrain:
       Thus outwards helps my inward grief maintain.

Now in this sand I would discharge my mind,
       And cast from me part of my burd’nous cares:
But in the sand my tales foretold I find,
       And see therein how well the writer fares.
       Since, stream, air, sand, mine eyes and ears conspire:
       What hope to quench, where each thing blows the fire?
   And as soon as she had written them, a new swarm of thoughts stinging her mind, she was ready with her foot to give the newborn letters both death and burial. But Philoclea, whose delight of hearing and seeing was before a stay from interrupting her, gave herself to be seen unto her, with such a lightning of beauty upon Zelmane that neither she could look on,.nor would look off. At last Philoclea, having a little mused how to cut the thread even between her own hopeless affection and her father’s unbridled hope, with eyes, cheeks and lips (whereof each sang their part to make up the harmony of bashfulness) began to say, ‘My father, to whom I owe myself, and therefore ...’ when Zelmane (making a womanish habit to be the armour of her boldness, giving up her life to the bps of Philoclea, and taking it again by the sweetness of those kisses) humbly besought her to keep her speech for a while within the paradise of her mind. For well she knew her father’s errand, who should soon receive a sufficient answer. But now she demanded leave not to lose this long sought-for commodity of time, to ease her heart thus far, that if in her agonies her destiny was to be condemned by Philoclea’s mouth, at least Philoclea might know whom she had condemned. Philoclea easily yielded to grant her own desire; and so making the green bank the situation, and the river the prospect of the most beautiful buildings of nature, Zelmane, doubting how to begin, though her thoughts already had run to the end, with a mind fearing the unworthiness of every word that should be presented to her ears, at length brought it forth in this manner.
   ‘Most beloved lady, the incomparable excellencies of yourself (waited on by the greatness of your estate) and the importance of the thing (whereon my life consisteth) doth require both many ceremonies before the beginning and many circumstances in the uttering my speech, both bold and fearful. But the small opportunity of envious occasion (by the malicious eye hateful love doth cast upon me) and the extreme bent of my affection (which will either break out in words or break my heart) compel me not only to embrace the smallest time but to pass by the respects due unto you, in respect of your poor caitiff’s life, who is now or never to be preserved. I do therefore vow unto you hereafter never more to omit all dutiful form: do you only now vouchsafe to hear the matter of a mind most perplexed. If ever the sound of love have come to your ears, or if ever you have understood what force it hath had to conquer the strongest hearts and change the most settled estates, receive here an example of those strange tragedies - one, that in himself containeth the particularities of all those misfortunes; and from henceforth believe that such a thing may be, since you shall see it is. You shall see, I say, a living image and a present story of what love can do when he is bent to ruin.
   ‘But alas, whither goest thou, my tongue, or how doth my heart consent to adventure the revealing his nearest touching secret? But peace, fear, thou comest too late when already the harm is taken. Therefore I say again, O only princess, attend here a miserable miracle of affection. Behold here before your eyes, Pyrocles, prince of Macedon, whom you only have brought to this game of fortune and unused metamorphosis, whom you only have made neglect his country, forget his father and lastly, forsake to be Pyrocles: the same Pyrocles who, you heard, was betrayed by being put in a ship, which being burned, Pyrocles was drowned. O most true presage! For these traitors, my eyes, putting me into a ship of'desire which daily burneth - those eyes, I say, which betrayed me, will never leave till they have drowned me. But be not, be not, most excellent lady (you that Nature hath made to be the lode-star of comfort) be not the rock of shipwreck. You whom virtue hath made the princess of felicity, be not the minister of ruin. You whom my choice hath made the goddess of my safety, O let not, let not from you be poured upon me destruction. Your fair face hath many tokens in it of amazement at my words. Think then what his amazement is from whence they come, since no words can carry with them the life of the inward feeling. I desire that my desire may be weighed in the balances of honour, and let virtue hold them. For if the highest love in no base person may aspire to grace, then may I hope your beauty will not be without pity. If otherwise you be (alas, but let it never be so) resolved, yet shall not my death be comfortless, receiving it by your sentence.’
   The joy which wrought into Pygmalion’s mind, while he found his beloved image was softer and warmer in his folded arms till at length it accomplished his gladness with a perfect woman's shape (still beautified with the former perfections) was even such as, by each degree of Zelmane’s words, creepingly entered into Philoclea, till her pleasure was fully made up with the manifesting of his being, which was such as in hope did overcome hope. Yet doubt would fain have played his part in her mind and called in question how she should be assured that Zelmane was Pyrocles. But love straight stood up and deposed that a he could not come from the mouth of Zelmane. Besides, a certain spark of honour which rose in her well-disposed mind made her fear to be alone with him with whom alone she desired to be, with all the other contradictions growing in those minds which neither absolutely climb the rock of virtue nor freely sink into the sea of vanity. But that spark soon gave place, or at least gave no more light in her mind than a candle doth in the sun’s presence; but even sick with a surfeit of joy and fearful of she knew not what - as he that newly finds huge treasures doubts whether he sleep or no; or like a fearful deer, which then looks most about when he comes to the best feed - with a shrugging kind of tremor through all her principal parts, she gave these affectionate words for answer.
   ‘Alas, how painful a thing it is to a divided mind to make a well-joined answer! How hard it is to bring inward shame to outward confession! And what handsomeness, trow you, can be observed in that speech which is made one knows not to whom? Shall I say, “O Zelmane”? Alas, your words be against it. Shall I say "Prince Pyrocles”? Wretch that I am, your show is manifest against it. But this, this I may well say: if I had continued as I ought, Philoclea, you had either never been, or ever been Zelmane: you had either never attempted this change, set on with hope, or never discovered it, stopped with despair. But I fear me, my behaviour, ill governed, gave you the first comfort: I fear me, my affection, ill hid, hath given you this last assurance. I fear, indeed, the weakness of my government before, made you think such a mask would be grateful unto me; and my weaker government since, makes you to pull off the visor. What shall I do then? Shall I seek far-fetched inventions? Shall I labour to lay marble colours over my ruinous thoughts? Or rather, though the pureness of my virgin-mind be stained, let me keep the true simplicity of my word. True it is, alas, too true it is, O Zelmane (for so I love to call thee, since in that name my love first began, and in the shade of that name my love shall best he hidden) that even while so thou wert (what eye bewitched me I know not) my passions were fitter to desire than to be desired. Shall I say then, I am sorry, or that my love must be turned to hate, since thou art turned to Pyrocles? How may that well be, since when thou wert Zelmane, the despair thou mightest not be thus did most torment me? Thou hast then the victory: use it with virtue. Thy virtue won me: with virtue preserve me. Dost thou love me? Keep me then still worthy to be beloved.’
   Then held she her tongue and cast down a self-accusing look, finding that in herself she had, as it were, shot out of the bow of her affection a more quick opening of her mind than she minded to have done. But Pyrocles, so carried up with joy that he did not envy the gods’ felicity, presented her with some jewels of right princely value, as some little tokens of his love and quality; and withal showed her letters from his father, King Euarchus, unto him, which even in the sea had amongst his jewels been preserved. But little needed those proofs to one who would have fallen out with herself rather than make any contrary conjectures to Zelmane’s speeches; so that with such embracements, as it seemed their souls desired to meet and their hearts to kiss as their mouths did, they passed the promise of marriage, which fain Pyrocles would have sealed with the chief arms of his desire, but Philoclea commanded the contrary.
   And then at Philoclea’s entreaty, who was willing to purloin all occasions of remaining with Zelmane, she told her the story of her life from the time of their departing from Erona, for the rest she had already understood of her sister. ‘For,’ said she, ‘I have understood how you first, in the company of your noble cousin Musidorus, parted from Thessalia, and of divers adventures which with no more danger than glory you passed through, till your coming to the succour of the queen Erona; and the end of that war you might perceive by myself I had understood of prince Plangus. But what since was the course of your doings until you came, after so many victories, to make a conquest of poor me, that I know not; the fame thereof having rather showed it by pieces than delivered any full form of it Therefore, dear Pyrocles - for what can mine ears be so sweetly fed with as to hear you of you - be hberal unto me of those things which have made you indeed precious to the world; and now doubt not to tell of your perils, for since I have you here out of them, even the remembrance of them is pleasant.’
   Pyrocles easily perceived she was content with kindness to put off occasion of further kindness, wherein love showed himself a cowardly boy that durst not attend for fear of offending. But rather love proved himself vahant that durst with the sword of reverent duty gain-stand the force of so many enraged desires. But so it was, that though he knew this discourse was to entertain him from a more straight parley, yet he durst not but kiss his rod, and gladly make much of that entertainment which she allotted unto him: and therefore, with a desirous sigh chastening his breast for too much desiring:
   ‘Sweet princess of my life,’ said he, 'what trophies, what triumph, what monuments, what histories might ever make my fame yield so sweet a music to my ears, as that it pleaseth you to lend your mind to the knowledge of any thing touching Pyrocles, only therefore of value, because he is your Pyrocles? And therefore grow I now so proud as to think it worth the hearing, since you vouchsafe to give it the hearing. Therefore, only height of my hope, vouchsafe to know that after the death of Tiridates, and settling Erona in her government - for settled we left her - howsoever since (as I perceived by your speech the last day) the ungrateful treason of her ill-chosen husband overthrew her, a thing, in truth, never till this time by me either heard or suspected: for who could think, without having such a mind as Anti- philus, that so great a beauty as Erona’s (indeed excellent) could not have held his affection, so great goodness could not have satisfied his ambition? But therefore true it is that wickedness may well be compared to a bottomless pit, into which it is far easier to keep one’s self from falling than, being fallen, to give one’s self any stay from falling infinitely. But for my cousin and me, upon this cause we parted from Erona.'
   CHAPTER 18
   ‘Euardes, the brave and mighty prince, whom It was my fortune to kill in the combat for Erona, had three nephews, sons to a sister of his; all three set among the foremost ranks of fame, for great minds to attempt and great force to perform what they did attempt, especially the eldest, by name Anaxius, to whom all men would willingly have yielded the height of praise but that his nature was such as to bestow it upon himself before any could give it. For of so unsupportable a pride he was, that where his deeds might well stir envy, his demeanour did rather breed disdain. And if it be true that the giants ever made war against heaven, he had been a fit ensign-bearer for that company. For nothing seemed hard to him, though impossible; and nothing unjust, while his liking was his justice. Now he in these wars had flatly refused his aid, because he could not brook that the worthy prince Plangus was by his cousin Tiridates preferred before him. For allowing no other weights but the sword and spear in judging of desert, how much he esteemed himself before Plangus in that, so much would he have had his allowance in his service.
   But now that he understood that his uncle was slain by me, I think rather scorn that any should kill his uncle than any kindness (an unused guest to an arrogant soul) made him seek his revenge, I must confess in manner gallant enough. For he sent a challenge unto me to meet him at a place appointed, in the confines of the kingdom of Lyda, where he would prove upon me that I had by some treachery overcome his uncle, whom else many hundreds such as I could not have withstood. Youth and success made me willing enough to accept any such bargain, especially because I had heard that your cousin Amphialus (who for some years hath universally borne the name of the best knight in the world) had divers times fought with him and never been able to master him, but so had left him that every man thought Anaxius in that one virtue of courtesy far short of him, in all other his match; Anaxius still deeming himself for his superior. Therefore to him I would go, ’and I would needs go alone because so, I understood for certain, he was; and, I must confess, desirous to do something without the company of the incomparable prince Musi- dorus, because in my heart I acknowledge that I owed more to his presence than to anything in myself, whatsoever before I had done. For of him indeed, as of any worldly cause, I must grant as received whatever there is or may be good in me. He taught me by word and best by example, giving me in him so lively an image of virtue as ignorance could not cast such mist over mine eyes as not to see and to love it; and all with such dear friendship and care as, O heaven, how can my life ever requite unto him? Which made me indeed find in myself such a kind of depending upon him as, without him, I found a weakness and a mistrustfulness of myself as one strayed from his best strength, when at any time I missed him. Which humour perceiving to over-rule me, I strave against it: not that I was unwilling to depend upon him in judgement, but by weakness I would not; which though it held me to him, made me unworthy of him. Therefore I desired his leave and obtained it, such confidence he had in me, preferring my reputation before his own tenderness; and so privately went from him, he determining, as after I knew, in secret manner not to be far from the place where we appointed to meet, to prevent any foul play that might be offered unto me. Full loth was Erona to let us depart from her, as it were, fore-feeling the harms which after fell to her. But I, (rid fully from those cumbers of kindness, and half a day’s journey in my way towards Anaxius) met an adventure which, though in itself of small importance, I will tell you at large, because by the occasion thereof I was brought to as great cumber and danger as lightly any might escape.
   ‘As I passed through a land, each side whereof was so bordered both with high timber trees and copses of far more humble growth, that it might easily bring a solitary mind to look for no other companions than the wild burgesses of the forest, I heard certain cries, which, coming by pauses to mine ears from within the wood of the right hand, made me well assured by the greatness of the cry it was the voice of a man, though it were a very unmanlike voice so to cry. But making mine ear my guide, I left not many trees behind me before I saw at the bottom of one of them a gentleman, bound with many garters hand and foot so as well he might tumble and toss, but neither run nor resist he could. Upon him, like so many eagles upon an ox, were nine gentlewomen, truly such as one might well enough say, they were handsome. Each of them held bodkins in their hands wherewith they continually pricked him, having been beforehand unarmed of any defence from the waist upward, but only of his shirt; so as the poor man wept and bled, cried and prayed, while they sported themselves in his pain and delighted in his prayers as the arguments of their victory.
   ‘I was moved to compassion, and so much the more that he straight called to me for succour, desiring me at least to kill him to deliver him from those tormentors. But before myself could resolve, much less any other tell what I would resolve, there came in choleric haste towards me about seven or eight knights, the foremost of which willed me to get me away, and not to trouble the ladies while they were taking their due revenge; but with so overmastering a manner of pride as truly my heart could not brook it: and therefore, answering them that how I would have defended him from the ladies I knew not, but from them I would, I began to combat first with him particularly, and after his death with the others (that had less good manners) jointly. But such was the end of it that I kept the field with the death of some and flight of others. Insomuch as the women, afraid what angry victory would bring forth, ran all away, saving only one, who was so fleshed in malice that neither during nor after the fight she gave any truce to her cruelty, but still used the little instrument of her great spite, to the well-witnessed pain of the impatient patient; and was now about to put out his eyes (which all this while were spared, because they should do him the discomfort of seeing who prevailed over him) when I came in, and after much ado brought her to some conference - for some time it was before she would hearken, more before she would speak, and most before she would in her speech leave off the sharp remembrance of her bodkin. But at length when I pulled off my head-piece and humbly entreated her pardon, or knowledge why she was cruel, out of breath more with choler which increased in his own exercise)than with the pain she took, much to this purpose she gave her grief unto my knowledge.
   ‘ “Gentleman,” said she, “much it is against my will to forbear any time the executing of my just revenge upon this naughty creature, a man in nothing but in deceiving women. But because I see you are young, and like enough to have the power, if you would have the mind, to do much more mischief than he, I am content upon this bad subject to read a lecture to your virtue. This man called Pamphilus in birth I must confess is noble (but what is that to him, if it shall be a stain to his dead ancestors to have left such an offspring?) in shape as you see, not uncomely (indeed the fit mask of his disguised falsehood) in conversation wittily pleasant and pleasantly gamesome; his eyes full of merry simplicity, his words, of hearty companionableness; and such a one whose head one would not think so stayed as to think mischievously; delighted in all such things which by imparting their delight to others, makes the user thereof welcome, as music, dancing, hunting, feasting, riding, and such like. And to conclude, such an one as who can keep him at arms-end need never wish a better companion.
   ‘ “But under these qualities lies such a poisonous adder as I will tell you. For by those gifts of nature and fortune, being in all places acceptable, he creeps - nay, to say truly, he flies so into the favour of poor silly women that I would be too much ashamed to confess, if I had not revenge in my hand as well as shame in my cheeks. For his heart being wholly delighted in deceiving us, we could never be warned, but rather one bird caught served for a stale to bring in more. For the more he gat, the more still he showed that he, as it were, gave away to his new mistress when he betrayed his promises to the former. The cunning of his flattery, the readiness of his tears, the infiniteness of his vows, were but among the weakest threads of his net. But the stirring our own passions, and by the entrance of them to make himself lord of our forces, there lay his master’s part of cunning, making us now jealous, now envious, now proud of what we had, desirous of more; now giving one the triumph, to see him, that was prince of many, subject to her; now with an estranged look making her fear the loss of that mind, which indeed could never be had: never ceasing humbleness and diligence till he had embarked us in some such disadvantage as we could not return dry-shod; and then suddenly a tyrant, but a crafty tyrant For so would he use his imperiousness, that we had a delightful fear and an awe which made us loth to lose our hope. And, which is strangest, when sometimes with late repentance I think of it, I must confess even in the greatest tempest of my judgement was I never driven to think him excellent; and yet so could set my mind both to get and keep him, as though therein had laid my felicity: like them I have seen play at the ball grow extremely earnest who should have the ball, and yet every one knew it was but a ball.
    "But in the end the bitter sauce of the sport was that we had either our hearts broken with sorrow, or our estates spoiled with being at his direction, or our honours for ever lost, partly by our own faults, but principally by his faulty using of our faults. For never was there man that could with more scornful eyes behold her at whose feet he had lately lain, nor with a more unmanlike bravery use his tongue to her disgrace, which lately had sung sonnets of her praises; being so naturally inconstant as I marvel his soul finds not some way to kill his body whereto it had been so long united. For so hath he dealt with us, unhappy fools, as we could never tell whether he made greater haste after he once liked, to enjoy, or after he once enjoyed, to forsake. But making a glory of his own shame, it delighted him to be challenged of unkindness; it was a triumph unto him to have his mercy called for, and he thought the fresh colours of his beauty were painted in nothing so well as in the ruins of his lovers: yet so far had we engaged ourselves, unfortunate souls, that we listed not complain, since our complaints could not but carry the greatest accusation to ourselves. But every of us, each for herself, laboured all means how to recover him, while he rather daily sent us companions of our deceit than ever returned in any sound and faithful manner. Till at length he concluded all his wrongs with betrothing himself to one, I must confess, worthy to be liked, if any worthiness might excuse so unworthy a changeableness, leaving us nothing but remorse for what was past and despair of what might follow. Then indeed the common injury made us all join in fellowship, who till that time had employed our endeavours one against the other; for we thought nothing was a more condemning of us than the justifying of his love to her by marriage. Then despair made fear valiant, and revenge gave shame countenance: whereupon we, that you saw here, devised how to get him among us alone; which he (suspecting no such matter of them whom he had by often abuses he thought made tame to be still abused) easily gave us opportunity to do.
    “And a man may see, even in this, how soon rulers grow proud, and in their pride foolish. He came with such an authority among us, as if the planets had done enough for us that by us once he had been delighted. And when we began in courteous manner, one after the other, to lay his unkindness unto him, he, seeing himself confronted by so many, like a resolute orator, went not to denial, but to justify his cruel falsehood, and all with such jests and disdainful passages that, if the injury could not be made greater, yet were our conceits made the apter to apprehend it.
   ‘ “Among other of his answers, forsooth, I shall never forget how he would prove it was no inconstancy to change from one love to another, but a great constancy; and contrary, that which we call constancy to be most changeable. Tor,’ said he, ‘I ever loved my delight, and delighted always in what was lovely: and wheresoever I found occasion to obtain that, I constantly followed it. But these constant fools you speak of, though their mistress grow by sickness foul, or by fortune miserable, yet still will love her, and so commit the absurdest inconstancy that may be, in changing their love from fairness to foulness, and from loveliness to his contrary; like one not content to leave a friend, but will straight give over himself to his mortal enemy: where I (whom you call inconstant) am ever constant - to beauty, in others, and delight, in myself.' And so in this jolly scoffing bravery he went over us all, saying he left one because she was over-wayward; another, because she was too soon won; a third, because she was not merry enough; a fourth, because she was over gamesome; the fifth because she was grown with grief subject to sickness; the sixth, because she was so foolish as to be jealous of him; the seventh, because she had refused to carry a letter for him to another that he loved; the eighth, because she was not secret; the ninth, because she was not liberal: but to me, who am named Dido (and indeed have met with a false Aeneas) to me, I say - O the ungrateful villainy - he could find no other fault to object but that, perdy, he met with many fairer.
   “But when he had thus played the careless prince, we (having those servants of ours in readiness, whom you lately so manfully overcame) laid hold of him, beginning at first but that trifling revenge in which you found us busy; but meaning afterwards to have mangled him so as should have lost his credit for ever abusing more. But as you have made my fellows fly away, so for my part the greatness of his wrong overshadows, in my judgement, the greatness of any danger. For was it not enough for him to have deceived me, and through the deceit abused me, and after the abuse forsaken me, but that he must now, of all the company, and before all the company, lay want of beauty to my charge? Many fairer? I trow even in your judgement, sir, if your eyes do not beguile me, not many fairer; and I know, whosoever says the contrary, there are not many fairer. And of whom should I receive this reproach, but of him who hath best cause to know there are not many fairer? And therefore howsoever my fellows pardon his injuries, for my part I will ever remember, and remember to revenge this scorn of all scorns.” With that she to him afresh; and surely would have put out his eyes (who lay mute for shame if he did not sometimes cry for fear) if I had not leapt from my horse and mingling force with entreaty, stayed her fury.
   ‘But while I was persuading her to meekness, comes a number of his friends, to whom he forthwith cried that they should kill that woman that had thus betrayed and disgraced him. But then I was fain to forsake the ensign under which I had before served, and to spend my uttermost force in the protecting of the lady: which so well prevailed for her that in the end there was a faithful peace promised of all sides. And so I, leaving her in a place of security, as she thought, went on my journey towards Anaxius, for whom I was fain to stay two days in the appointed place, he disdaining to wait for me till he was sure I was there.’
   CHAPTER 19
   ‘I did patiently abide his angry pleasure till about that space of time he came (indeed, according to promise, alone) and - that I may not say too little, because he is wont to say too much - like a man whose courage was apt to climb over any danger. And as soon as ever he came near me, in fit distance for his purpose, he with much fury but with fury skilfully guided, ran upon me, which I, in the best sort I could, resisted, having kept myself ready for him, because I had understood that he observed few compliments in matters of arms but such as a proud anger did indite unto him. And so, putting our horses into a full career, we hit each other upon the head with our lances. I think he felt my blow. For my part, I must confess, I never received the like; but I think, though my senses were astonished, my mind forced them to quicken themselves because I had learned of him how little favour he is wont to show in any matter of advantage. And indeed he was turned and coming upon me with his sword drawn, both our staves having been broken at that encounter, but I was so ready to answer him that truly I know not who gave the first blow. But whosoever gave the first was quickly seconded by the second. And indeed, excellentest lady, I must say truly, for a time it was well fought between us; he undoubtedly being of singular valour - I would to God it were not abased by his too much loftiness. But as, by the occasion of the combat winning and losing ground, we changed places, his horse happened to come upon the point of the broken spear which (fallen to the ground) chanced to stand upward, so as it lighting upon his heart, the horse died. He, driven to dismount, threatened if I did not the like to do as much for my horse as fortune had done for his. But whether for that, or because I would not be beholding to fortune for any part of the victory, I descended.
   ‘So began our foot-fight in such sort that we were well entered to blood of both sides, when there comes by that inconstant Pam- philus, whom I had delivered (easy to be known, for he was barefaced) with a dozen armed men after him; but before him he had Dido, that lady who had most sharply punished him, riding upon a palfrey, he following her with most unmanlike cruelty, beating her with wands he had in his hand, she crying for sense of pain or hope of succour: which was so pitiful a sight unto me that it moved me to require Anaxius to defer our combat till another day, and now to perform the duties of knighthood in helping this distressed lady. But he that disdains to obey anything but his passion (which he calls his mind) bade me leave off that thought; but when he had killed me, he would then, perhaps, go to her succour. But I well finding the fight would be long between us, longing in my heart to deliver the poor Dido, giving him so great a blow as somewhat stayed him (to term it aright) I flatly ran away from him toward my horse, who trotting after the company, in mine armour I was put to some pain but that use made me nimble unto it But as I followed my horse, Anaxius followed me; but his proud heart did so disdain that exercise that I had quickly over-run him and overtaken my horse, being, I must confess, ashamed to see a number of country folks who happened to pass thereby, who halloed and hooted after me as at the arrantest coward that ever showed his shoulders to his enemy. But when I had leapt on my horse (with such speedy agility that they all cried: “O see how fear gives him wings”) I turned to Anaxius, and aloud promised him to return thither again as soon as I had relieved the injured lady. But he railing at me with all the base words angry contempt could indite, I said no more but “Anaxius, assure thyself I neither fear thy force nor thy opinion.” And so using no weapon of a knight as at that time but my spurs, I ran (in my knowledge) after Pamphilus, but (in all their conceits) from Anaxius, which, as far as I could hear, I might well hear testified with such laughters and games that I was some few times moved to turn back again.
   ‘But the lady's misery over-balanced my reputation, so that after her I went, and with six hours’ hard riding (through so wild places as it was rather the cunning of my horse sometimes than of myself so rightly to hit the way) I overgat them a little before night, near to an old ill-favoured castle, the place where I perceived they meant to perform their unknightly errand. For there they began to strip her of her clothes, when I came in among them and running through the first with a lance, the justness of the cause so enabled me against the rest (false-hearted in their own wrong-doing) that I had, in as short time almost as I had been fighting with only Anaxius, delivered her from those injurious wretches, most of whom carried news to the other world that amongst men secret wrongs are not always left unpunished. As for Pamphilus, he, having once seen and, as it should seem, remembered me, even from the beginning began to be in the rearward, and before they had left fighting, he was too far off to give them thanks for their pains. But when I had delivered to the lady a full liberty, both in effect and in opinion - for some time it was before she could assure herself she was out of their hands who had laid so vehement apprehension of death upon her - she then told me how, as she was returning toward her father’s, weakly accompanied as too soon trusting to the falsehood of reconcilement, Pamphilus had set upon her and, killing those that were with her, carried herself by such force and with such manner as I had seen to this place, where he meant in cruel and shameful manner to kill her in the sight of her own father, to whom he had already sent word of it, that out of his castle window (for this castle, she said, was his) he might have the prospect of his only child’s destruction, if my coming (whom, she said, he feared as soon as he knew me by the armour) had not warranted her from the near-approaching cruelty. I was glad I had done so good a deed for a gentlewoman not unhandsome, whom before I had in like sort helped. But the night beginning to persuade some retiring place, the gentlewoman, even out of countenance before she began her speech, much after this manner invited me to lodge that night with her father.
     ‘"Sir," said she, "how much I owe you can be but abased by words, since the life I have, I hold it now the second time of you; and therefore need not offer service unto you, but only to remember you that I am your servant: and I would my being so might any way yield any small contentment unto you. Now only I can but desire you to harbour yourself this night in this castle, because the time requires it; and in truth this country is very dangerous for murdering thieves, to trust a sleeping life among them. And yet I must confess that as the love I bear you makes me thus invite you, so the same love makes me ashamed to bring you to a place where you shall be so (not spoken by ceremony but by truth) miserably entertained.”
   ‘With that she told me that though she spake of her father, whom she ramed Chremes, she would hide no truth from me: which was in sum, that as he was of all that region the man of greatest possessions and riches, so was he, either by nature or an evil received opinion, given to sparing in so unmeasurable sort, that he did not only bar himself from the delightful, but almost from the necessary use thereof, scarcely allowing himself fit sustenance of life rather than he would spend of those goods for whose sake only he seemed to joy in life. Which extreme dealing, descending from himself upon her, had driven her to put herself with a great lady of that country, by which occasion she had stumbled upon such mischances as were little for the honour either of her or her family. But so wise had he showed himself therein, as while he found his daughter maintained without his cost, he was content to be deaf to any noise of infamy; which though it had wronged her much more than she deserved, yet she could not deny but she was driven thereby to receive more than decent favours. She concluded, that there at least I should be free from injuries, and should be assured to her-wards to abound as much in the true causes of welcomes as I should find want of the effects thereof.
   ‘I, who had acquainted myself to measure the delicacy of food and rest by hunger and weariness, at that time well stored of both did not abide long entreaty but went with her to the castle, which found of good strength, having a great moat round about it, the work of a noble gentleman of whose unthrifty son he had bought it: the bridge drawn up, where we were fain to cry a good while before we could have anwer, and to dispute a good while before answer would be brought to acceptance. At length a willingness rather than a joy to receive his daughter whom he had so lately seen so near death, and an opinion brought into his head by course because he heard himself called a father, rather than any kindness that he found in his own heart, made him take us in; for my part by that time grown so weary of such entertainment, that no regard of myself but only the importunity of his daughter made me enter. Where I was met with this Chremes, a drivelling old fellow, lean, shaking both of head and hands, already half earth and yet then most greedy of earth; who scarcely would give me thanks for what I had done, for fear, I suppose, that thankfulness might have an introduction of reward; but with a hollow voice giving me a false welcome, I might perceive in his eye to his daughter that it was hard to say whether the displeasure of her company did not overweigh the pleasure of her own coming.
   But on he brought me into so bare a house that it was the picture of miserable happiness and rich beggary, served only by a company of rustical villains, full of sweat and dust, not one of them other than a labourer: in sum, as he counted it, profitable drudgery; and all preparations both for food and lodging such as would make one detest niggardness, it is so sluttish a vice. His talk of nothing but of his poverty, for fear, belike, lest I should have proved a young borrower. In sum, such a man as any enemy could not wish him worse than to be himself. But there that night bid I the burden of being a tedious guest to a loathsome host, overhearing him sometimes bitterly warn his daughter of bringing such costly mates under his roof: which she grieving at, desired much to know my name, I think partly of kindness to remember who had done something for her, and partly because she assured herself I was such a one as would make even his miser-mind contented with what he had done. And accordingly, she demanded my name and estate, with such earnestness that I (whom love had not as then so robbed me of myself as to be other than I am) told her directly my name and condition; whereof she was no more glad than her father, as I might well perceive by some ill-favoured cheerfulness which then first began to wrinkle itself in his face.
   'But the causes of their joys were far different. For as the shepherd and the butcher both may look upon one sheep with pleasing conceits, but the shepherd with mind to profit himself by preserving, the butcher with killing him; so she rejoiced to find that mine own benefits had tied me to be her friend who was a prince of such greatness, and lovingly rejoiced; but his joy grew, as I to my danger after perceived, by the occasion of the queen Artaxia’s setting my head to sale for having slain her brother Tiridates; which being the sum of an hundred thousand crowns to whosoever brought me alive into her hands, that old wretch (who had over-lived all good nature) though he had lying idly by him much more than that, yet above all things loving money, for money's own sake determined to betray me (so well deserving of him) for to have that which he was determined never to use. And so knowing that the next morning I was resolved to go to the place where I had left Anaxius, he sent in all speed to a captain of a garrison near by, which though it belonged to the king of Iberia, yet knowing the captain’s humour to delight so in riotous spending as he cared not how he came by the means to maintain it, doubted not that to be half with him in the gain he would play his quarter’s part in the treason. And therefore that night agreeing of the fittest places where they might surprise me in the morning, the old caitiff was grown so ceremonious as he would needs accompany me some miles in my way; a sufficient token to me, if nature had made me apt to suspect, since a churl's courtesy rarely comes but either for gain or falsehood. But I suffered him to stumble into that point of good manner: to which purpose he came out with all his clowns, horsed upon such cart-jades, and so furnished as in good faith I thought with myself, if that were thrift, I wished none of my friends or subjects ever to thrive. As for his daughter, the gentle Dido, she would also (but in my conscience with a far better mind) prolong the time of farewell as long as he.
   ‘And so we went on together; he so old in wickedness that he could look me in the face and freely talk with me, whose life he had already contracted for: till coming into the falling of a way which led us into a place, of each side whereof men might easily keep themselves undiscovered, I was encompassed suddenly by a great troop of enemies, both of horse and foot, who willed me to yield myself to the queen Artaxia. But they could not have used worse eloquence to have persuaded my yielding than that - I knowing the little goodwill Artaxia bare me. And therefore making necessity and justice my best sword and shield, I used the other weapons I had as well as I could - am sure to the little ease of a good number, who trusting to their number more than to their valour, and valuing money higher than equity, felt that guiltlessness is not always with ease oppressed. As for Chremes, he withdrew himself, yet so gilding his wicked conceits with his hope of gain that he was content to be a beholder how I should be taken to make his prey.
   ‘But I was grown so weary that I supported myself more with anger than strength, when the most excellent Musidorus came to my succour; who, having followed my trace as well as he could after he found I had left the fight with Anaxius, came to the niggard's castle, where he found all burned and spoiled by the country people, who bare mortal hatred to that covetous man and now took the time, when the castle was left almost without guard, to come in and leave monuments of their malice therein: which Musidorus not staying either to further or impeach, came upon the spur after me, because with one voice many told him that if I were in his company, it was for no good meant unto me, and in this extremity found me. But when I saw that cousin of mine, methought my life was doubled, and where before I thought of a noble death, I now thought of a noble victory. For who can fear that hath Musidorus by him? - who what he did there for me, how many he killed (not stranger for the number than for the strange blows wherewith he sent them to a well-deserved death) might well delight me to speak of, but I should so hold you too long in every particular. But in truth, there if ever, and ever, if ever any man, did Musidorus show himself second to none in able valour.
   ‘Yet what the unmeasurable excess of their number would have done in the end I know not, but the trial thereof was cut off by the chanceable coming thither of the king of Iberia, that same father of the worthy Plangus whom it hath pleased you sometimes to mention; who (not yielding over to old age his country delights, especially of hawking) was at that time (following a merlin) brought to see this injury offered unto us; and having great numbers of courtiers waiting upon him, was straight known by the soldiers that assaulted us to be their king, and so most of them withdrew themselves.
   ‘He, by his authority knowing of the captain's own constrained confession what was the motive of this mischievous practice, misliking much such violence should be offered in his country to men of our rank, but chiefly disdaining it should be done in respect of his niece whom (I must confess wrongfully) he hated because he interpreted that her brother and she had maintained his son Plangus against him, caused the captain’s head presently to be stricken off, and the old bad Chremes to be hanged - though truly for my part, I earnestly laboured for his life, because I had eaten of his bread. But one thing was notable for a conclusion of his miserable life, that neither the death of his daughter, who (alas, poor gentlewoman) was by chance slain among his clowns, while she (over-boldly for her weak sex) sought to hold them from me, nor yet his own shameful end was so much in his mouth as he was led to execution, as the loss of his goods and burning of his house which often, with more laughter than tears of the hearers, he made pitiful exclamations upon.'
   CHAPTER 20 
   ‘This justice thus done and we delivered, the king indeed in royal sort invited us to his court not far thence, in all points entertaining us so as truly I must ever acknowledge a beholding-ness unto him, although the stream of it fell out not to be so sweet as the spring. For after some days being there (curing ourselves of such wounds as we had received) while I, causing diligent search to be made of Anaxius, could learn nothing but that he was gone out of the country, boasting in every place how he had made me run away, we were brought to receive the favour of acquaintance with this Queen Andromana, whom the princess Pamela did in so lively colours describe the last day as still methinks the figure thereof possesseth mine eyes, confirmed by the knowledge myself had.
   ‘And therefore I shall need the less to make you know what kind of woman she was; but this only, that first with the reins of affection, and after with the very use of directing, she had made herself so absolute a master of her husband's mind that awhile he would not, and after, he could not tell how to govern without being governed by her: but finding an ease in not understanding, let loose his thoughts wholly to pleasure, entrusting to her the entire conduct of all his royal affairs. A thing that may luckily fall out to him that hath the blessing to match with some heroical- minded lady. But in him it was neither guided by wisdom nor followed by fortune, but thereby was slipped insensibly into such an estate that he lived at her indiscreet discretion: all his subjects having by some years learned so to hope for good and fear of harm only from her, that it should have needed a stronger virtue than his to have unwound so deeply an entered vice. So that either not striving because he was contented, or contented because he would not strive, he scarcely knew what was done in his own chamber but as it pleased her instruments to frame the relation.
   ‘Now we being brought known unto her, the time that we spent in curing some very dangerous wounds, after once we were acquainted - and acquainted we were sooner than ourselves expected - she continually almost haunted us, till (and it was not long a doing) we discovered a most violent bent of affection, and that so strangely that we might well see an evil mind in authority doth not only follow the sway of the desires already within it, but frames to itself new desires not before thought of. For, with equal ardour she affected us both; and so did her greatness disdain shamefastness that she was content to acknowledge it to both. For, having many times tom the veil of modesty, it seemed for a last delight that she delighted in infamy, which often she had used to her husband’s shame, filling all men’s ears but his with his reproach; while he, hoodwinked with kindness, least of all men knew who strake him. But her first degree was, by setting forth her beauties (truly in nature not to be misliked, but as much advanced to the eye as abased to the judgement by art) thereby to bring us, as willingly caught fishes, to bite at her bait. And thereto had she that scutcheon of her desires supported by certain badly-diligent ministers, who often cloyed our ears with her praises, and would needs teach us a way of felicity by seeking her favour. But when she found that we were as deaf to them as dumb to her, then she listed no longer stay in the suburbs of her foolish desires but directly entered upon them, making herself an impudent suitor, authorizing herself very much with making us see that all favour and power in that realm so depended upon her, that now (being in her hands) we were either to keep or lose our liberty at her discretion; which yet awhile she so tempered as that we might rather suspect than she threaten.
   ‘But when our wounds grew so as that they gave us leave to travel, and that she found we were purposed to use all means we could to depart thence, she, with more and more importunateness, craved that which in all good manners was either of us to be desired, or not granted. Truly, most fair and every way excellent lady, you would have wondered to have seen how before us she would confess the contention in her own mind between that lovely, indeed most lovely, brownness of Musidorus' face, and this colour of mine, which she, in the deceivable style of affection, would entitle beautiful: how her eyes wandered, like a glutton at a feast, from the one to the other; and how her words would begin half of the sentence to Musidorus and end the other half to Pyrocles: not ashamed, seeing the friendship between us, to desire either of us to be a mediator to the other, as if we should have played one request at tennis between us; and often wishing that she might be the angle where the lines of our friendship might meet, and be the knot which might tie our hearts together. Which proceeding of hers I do the more largely set before you, most dear lady, because by the foil thereof you may see the nobleness of my desire to you and the warrantableness of your favour to me.’
   At that Philoclea smiled with a little nod. ‘But,’ said Pyrocles, ‘when she perceived no hope by suit to prevail, then, persuaded by the rage of affection and encouraged by daring to do anything, she found means to have us accused to the King as though we went about some practice to overthrow him in his own estate. Which, because of the strange successes we had had in the kingdoms of Phrygia, Pontus and Galatia, seemed not unlikely to him who, but skimming anything that came before him, was disciplined to leave the thorough-handling of all to his gentle wife; who forthwith caused us to be put in prison, having, while we slept, deprived us of our arms: a prison, indeed injurious because a prison, but else well testifying affection, because in all respects as commodious as a prison might be: and indeed so placed as she might at all hours (not seen by many, though she cared not much how many had seen her) come unto us.
   ‘Then fell she to sauce her desires with threatenings so that we were in a great perplexity, restrained to so unworthy a bondage, and yet restrained by love which (I cannot tell how) in noble minds by a certain duty claims an answering, And how much that love might move us, so much and more that faultiness of her mind removed us, her beauty being balanced by her shamelessness. But that which did, as it were, tie us in captivity was, that to grant had been wickedly injurious to him that had saved our lives; and to accuse a lady that loved us of her love unto us we esteemed almost as dishonourable: and but by one of those ways we saw no likelihood of going out of that place, where the words would be injurious to your ears which should express the manner of her suit; while yet many times earnestness dyed her cheeks with the colour of shamefastness, and wanton languishing borrowed of her eyes the down-cast look of modesty. But we in the meantime far from loving her, and often assuring her that we would not so recompense her husband’s saving of our lives; to such a ridiculous degree of trusting her she had brought him that she caused him send us word that upon our lives we should do whatsoever she commanded us: good man, not knowing any other but that all her pleasures were directed to the preservation of his estate. But when that made us rather pity than obey his folly, then fell she to servile entreating us, as though force could have been the school of love, or that an honest courage would not rather strive against, than yield to injury. All which yet could not make us accuse her, though it made us almost pine away for spite to lose any of our time in so troublesome an idleness.
   ‘But while we were thus full of weariness of what was past and doubt of what was to follow, love (that I think in the course of my life hath a sport sometimes to poison me with roses, sometimes to heal me with wormwood) brought forth a remedy unto us: which though it helped me out of that distress, alas, the conclusion was such that I must ever while I live think it worse than a wrack so to have been preserved. This king by this queen had a son of tender age, but of great expectation, brought up in the hope of themselves and already acceptation of the inconstant people as successor of his father’s crown, whereof he was as worthy (considering his parts) as unworthy in respect of the wrong was thereby done against the most noble Plangus: whose great deserts now either forgotten or ungratefully remembered, all men set their sails with the favourable wind which blew on the fortune of this young prince, perchance not in their hearts, but surely in their mouths; now giving Plangus (who some years before was their only champion) the poor comfort of calamity, pity.
   ‘This youth therefore accounted prince of that region, by name Palladius, d'd with vehement affection love a young lady brought up in his father’s court, called Zelmane, daughter to that mischievously unhappy prince Plexirtus (of whom already I have, and sometimes must make, but never honourable, mention) left there by her father, because of the intricate changeableness of his estate - he, by the mother’s side, being half brother to this queen Andromana, and therefore the willinger committing her to her care. But as love, alas, doth not always reflect itself, so fell it out that this Zelmane, though truly reason there was enough to love Palladius, yet could not ever persuade her heart to yield thereunto, with that pain to Palladius as they feel that feel an unloved love. Yet loving indeed, and therefore constant, he used still the intercession of diligence and faith, ever hoping, because he would not put himself into that hell to be hopeless; until the time of our being come and captived there brought forth this end, which truly deserves of me a further degree of sorrow than tears.
   ‘Such was therein my ill destiny, that this young lady Zelmane (like some unwisely liberal, that more delight to give presents than pay debts) she chose (alas the pity) rather to bestow her love (so much undeserved as not desired) upon me than to recompense him whose love (besides many other things) might seem (even in the court of honour) justly to claim it of her. But so it was (alas that so it was) whereby it came to pass that (as nothing doth more naturally follow his cause than care to preserve and benefit doth fo’low unfeigned affection) she felt with me what I felt of my captivity, and straight laboured to redress my pain, which was her pain: which she could do by no better means than by using the help therein of Palladius, who (true lover) considering what, and not why, in all her commandments (and indeed she concealing from him her affection, which she intituled compassion) immediately obeyed to employ his uttermost credit to relieve us: which though as great as a beloved son with a mother, faulty otherwise, but not hard-hearted towards him, yet it could not prevail to procure us liberty. Wherefore he sought to have that by practice which he could not by prayer. And so being allowed often to visit us - for indeed our restraints were more or less, according as the ague of her passion was either in the fit or intermission - he used the opportunity of a fit time thus to deliver us.’
   CHAPTER 21
   ‘The time of the marrying that queen was, every year, by the extreme love of her husband and the serviceable love of the courtiers, made notable by some public honours which did, as it were, proclaim to the world how dear she was to that people. Among other, none was either more grateful to the beholders or more noble in itself than jousts, both with sword and lance, maintained for a seven night together; wherein that nation doth so excel, both for comeliness and ableness, that from neighbour-countries they ordinarily come, some to strive, some to learn, some to behold.
   ‘This day it happened that divers famous knights came thither from the court of Helen, Queen of Corinth; a lady whom fame at that time was so desirous to honour that she borrowed all men's mouths to join with the sound of her trumpet. For as her beauty hath won the prize from all women that stand in degree of comparison - for as for the two sisters of Arcadia, they are far beyond all conceit of comparison - so hath her government been such as hath been no less beautiful to men’s judgements than her beauty to the eyesight For being brought by right of birth, a woman, a young woman, a fair woman, to govern a people in nature mutinously proud, and always before so used to hard governors as they knew not how to obey without the sword were drawn; yet could she for some years so carry herself among them that they found cause, in the delicacy of her sex, of admiration, not of contempt: and which was notable, even in the time that many countries about her were full of wars (which for old grudges to Corinth were thought still would conclude there) yet so handled she the matter, that the threats ever smarted in the threateners: she using so strange and yet so well succeeding a temper that she made her people by peace, warlike; her courtiers by sports, learned; her ladies by love, chaste. For by continual martial exercises without blood, she made them perfect in that bloody art. Her sports were such as carried riches of knowledge upon the stream of delight: and such the behaviour both of herself and her ladies as builded their chastity not upon waywardness, but choice of worthiness, so as it seemed that court to have been the marriage-place of love and virtue, and that herself was a Diana apparelled in the garments of Venus.
   And this which fame only delivered unto me - for yet I have never seen her - I am the willinger to speak of to you who, I know, know her better, being your near neighbour, because you may see by her example (in herself wise, and of others beloved) that neither folly is the cause of vehement love nor reproach the effect. For never, I think, was there any woman that with more unremovable determination gave herself to the counsel of love after she had once set before her mind the worthiness of your cousin Amphialus, and yet is neither her wisdom doubted of, nor honour blemished. For O God, what doth better become wisdom than to discern what is worthy the loving? What more agreeable to goodness than to love it, so discerned, and what to greatness of heart, than to be constant in it once loved? But at that time that love of hers was not so publicly known as the death of Philoxenus and her search of Amphialus hath made it; but then seemed to have such leisure to send thither divers choice knights of her court, because they might bring her at least the knowledge, perchance the honour, of that triumph.
   ‘Wherein so they behaved themselves as for three days they earned the prize; which being come from so far a place to disgrace her servants, Palladius, who himself had never used arms, persuaded the queen Andromana to be content, for the honour sake of her court, to suffer us two to have our horse and armour, that he with us might undertake the recovery of their lost honour; which she granted, taking our oath to go no further than her son, nor ever to abandon him. Which she did not more for saving him than keeping us: and yet not satisfied with our oath, appointed a band of horsemen to have eye that we should not go beyond appointed limits. We were willing to gratify the young prince who, we saw, loved us. And so the fourth day of that exercise we came into the field: where, I remember, the manner was that the forenoon they should run at tilt, one after the other, the afternoon in a broad field in manner of a battle, till either the strangers or that country knights won the field.
   ‘The first that ran was a brave knight, whose device was to come in all chained, with a nymph leading him. Against him came forth an Iberian, whose manner of entering was with bagpipes instead of trumpets; a shepherd’s boy before him for a page, and by him a dozen apparelled like shepherds for the fashion, though rich in stuff, who carried his lances, which though strong to give a lancely blow indeed, yet so were they coloured with hooks near the morne that they prettily represented sheep- hooks. His own furniture was dressed over with wool, so enriched with jewels artificially placed that one would have thought it a marriage between the lowest and the highest. His impresa was a sheep marked with pitch, with this word, “Spotted to be known.’’ And because I may tell you out his conceit (though that were not done, till the running for that time was ended) before the ladies departed from the windows - among whom there was one, they say, that was the Star whereby his course was only directed - the shepherds attending upon Philisides went among them and sang an eclogue; one of them answering another, while the other shepherds pulling out recorders, which possessed the place of pipes, accorded their music to the others’ voice. The eclogue had great praise. I only remember six verses, while having questioned one with the other of their fellow-shepherd’s sudden growing a man of arms and the cause of his so doing, they thus said:
Me thought some staves he miss'd: if so, not much amiss;
For where he most would hit, he ever yet did miss.
One said he brake across; full well it so might be:
For never was there man more crossly crossed than he.
But most cried, “O well broke”; O fool full gaily blest:
Where failing is a shame, and breaking is his best.
   Thus I have digressed, because his manner liked me well; but when he began to run against Lelius, it had near grown (though great love had ever been betwixt them) to a quarrel. For Phil- isides breaking his staves with great commendation, Lelius, who was known to be second to none in the perfection of that art, ran ever over his head but so finely, to the skilful eyes, that one might well see he showed more knowledge in missing than others did in hitting, for with so gallant a grace his staff came swimming close over the crest of the helmet, as if he would represent the kiss and not the stroke of Mars. But Philisides was much moved with it while he thought Lelius would show a contempt of his youth; till Lelius (who therefore would satisfy him because he was his friend) made him know that to such bondage he was for so many courses tied by her, whose disgraces to him were graced by her excellency, and whose injuries he could never otherwise return than honours.
   ‘But so by Lelius’ willing missing was the odds of the Iberian side, and continued so in the next by the excellent running of a knight, though fostered so by the Muses as many times the very rustic people left both their delights and profits to hearken to his songs, yet could he so well perform all armed sports as if he had never had any other pen than a lance in his hand. He came in like a wild man, but such a wildness as showed his eyesight had tamed him, full of withered leaves which, though they fell not, still threatened falling. His impresa was a mill-horse still bound to go in one circle, with this word, "Data fata secutus”. But after him the Corinthian knights absolutely prevailed, especially a great nobleman of Corinth, whose device was to come without any device, all in white like a new knight (as indeed he was) but so new as his newness shamed mast of the others' long exercise. Then another, from whose tent I remember a bird was made fly, with such art to carry a written embassage among the ladies, that one might say, if a live bird, how so taught; if a dead bird, how so made? Then he who hidden, man and horse, in a great figure lively representing the Phoenix, the fire took so artificially as it consumed the bird and left him to rise, as it were, out of the ashes thereof. Against whom was the fine frozen knight, frozen in despair; but his armour so naturally representing ice, and all his furniture so lively answering thereto, as yet did I never see anything that pleased me better.
   ‘But the delight of those pleasing sights have carried me too far into an unnecessary discourse. Let it then suffice, most excellent lady, that you know the Corinthians that morning in the exercise, as they had done the days before, had the better; Palladius neither suffering us nor himself to take in hand the party till the afternoon, when we were to fight in troops, not differing otherwise from earnest but that the sharpness of the weapons was taken away. But in the trial, Palladius (especially led by Musidorus, and somewhat aided by me) himself truly behaving himself nothing hke a beginner, brought the honour to rest itself that night on the Iberian side: and the next day, both morning and afternoon being kept by our party, he (that saw the time fit for the delivery he intended) called unto us to follow him, which we, both bound by oath and willing by goodwill, obeyed. And so the guard not daring to interrupt us, he commanding passage, we went after him upon the spur to a little house in a forest near by, which he thought would be the fittest resting place till we might go further from his mother’s fury, whereat he was no less angry and ashamed than desirous to obey Zelmane.
   ‘But his mother, as I learned since, understanding by the guard her son’s conveying us away, forgetting her greatness, and resigning modesty to more quiet thoughts, flew out from her place and cried to be accompanied, for she herself would follow us. But what she did, being rather with vehemency of passion than conduct of reason, made her stumble while she ran, and by her own confusion hinder her own desires. For so impatiently she commanded as a good while nobody knew what she commanded, so as we had gotten so far the start as to be already past the confines of her kingdom before she overtook us. And overtake us she did in the kingdom of Bithynia, not regarding shame, or danger of having entered into another’s dominions: but, having with her about a threescore horsemen, straight commanded to take us alive, and not to regard her son's threatening therein; which they attempted to do, first by speech, and then by force. But neither liking their eloquence nor fearing their might, we esteemed few swords in a just defence able to resist many unjust assaulters. And so Musidorus’ incredible valour, beating down all lets, made both me and Palladius so good way that we had little to do to overcome weak wrong.
   ‘And now had we the victory in effect without blood, when Palladius, heated with the fight and angry With his mother’s fault, so pin-sued our assailers that one of them (who, as I heard since, had before our coming been a special minion of Andromana’s and hated us for having dispossessed him of her heart) taking him to be one of us, with a traitorous blow slew his young prince: who falling down before our eyes whom he especially had delivered, judge, sweetest lady, whether anger might not be called justice in such a case. Once, so it wrought in us, that many of his subjects’ bodies we left there dead, to wait on him more faithfully to the other world.
   ‘All this while disdain, strengthened by the fury of a furious love, made Andromana stay to the last of the combat; and when she saw us light down to see what help we might do to the helpless Palladius, she came running madly unto us, then no less threatening when she had no more power to hurt. But when she perceived it was her only son that lay hurt, and that his hurt was so deadly as that already his life had lost the use of the reasonable, and almost sensible part, then only did misfortune lay his own ugliness upon her fault, and make her see what she had done and to what she was come; especially finding in us rather detestation than pity (considering the loss of that young prince) and resolution presently to depart, which still she laboured to stay. But deprived of all comfort, with eyes full of death, she ran to her son’s dagger, and before we were aware of it (who else would have stayed it) struck herself a mortal wound. But then her love, though not her person, awaked pity in us, and I went to her, while Musidorus laboured about Palladius. But the wound was past the cure of a better surgeon than myself, so as I could but receive some few of her dying words, which were cursings of her ill-set affection, and wishing unto me many crosses and mischances in my love, whensoever I should love, wherein I fear, and only fear, that her prayer is from above granted. But the noise of this fight and issue thereof being blazed by the country people to some noblemen thereabouts, they came thither, and finding the wrong offered us, let us go on our journey, we having recommended those royal bodies unto them to be conveyed to the king of Iberia.’
   With that Philoclea seeing the tears stand in his eyes with remembrance of Palladius, but much more of that which thereupon grew, she would needs drink a kiss from those eyes, and he suck another from her lips; whereat she blushed, and yet kissed him again to hide her blushing: which had almost brought Pyrocles into another discourse, but that she with so sweet a rigour forbade him that he durst not rebel, though he found it a great war to keep that peace, but was fain to go on in his story, for so she absolutely bade him, and he durst not how to disobey.
   
   CHAPTER 22 
   ‘So,’ said he, ‘parting from that place before the sun had much abased himself of his greatest height, we saw sitting upon the dry sands (which yielded at that time a very hot reflection) a fair gentlewoman, whose gesture accused her of much sorrow and every way showed she cared not what pain she put her body to, since the better part, her mind, was laid under so much agony: and so was she dulled, withal, that we could come so near as to hear her speeches and yet she not perceive the hearers of her lamentation.
   ‘But well we might understand her at times say, “Thou dost kill me with thy unkind falsehood; and it grieves me not to die, but it grieves me that thou art the murderer. Neither doth mine own pain so much vex me as thy error. For God knows, it would not trouble me to be slain for thee, but much it torments me to be slain by thee. Thou art untrue, Pamphilus, thou art untrue, and woe is me therefore. How oft did’st thou swear unto me that the sun should lose his light, and the rocks run up and down like little kids, before thou would’st falsify thy faith to me? Sun, therefore, put out thy shining, and rocks, run mad for sorrow; for Pamphilus is false. But alas, the sun keeps his light, though thy faith be darkened; the rocks stand still, though thou change like a weathercock. O fool that I am, that thought I could grasp water and bind the wind. I might well have known thee by others, but I would not; and rather wished to learn poison by drinking it myself, while my love helped thy words to deceive me. Well, yet I would thou had'st made a better choice when thou did’st forsake thy unfortunate Leucippe. But it is no matter; Baccha, thy new mistress, will revenge my wrongs. But do not, Baccha, let Pamphilus live happy, though I die.”
   ‘And much more to such like phrase she spake, but that I (who had occasion to know something of that Pamphilus) stepped to comfort her: and though I could not do that, yet I got thus much knowledge of her, that this being the same Leucippe to whom the unconstant Pamphilus had betrothed himself - which had moved the other ladies to such indignation as I told you - neither her worthiness (which in truth was great) nor his own suffering for her (which is wont to endear affection) could fetter his fickleness but that, before his marriage day appointed, he had taken to wife that Baccha of whom she complained: one that in divers places I had heard before blazed as the most impudently unchaste woman of all Asia, and withal of such an imperiousness therein that she would not stick to employ them whom she made unhappy with her favour to draw more companions of their folly: in the multitude of whom she did no less glory than a captain would do of being followed by brave soldiers: waywardly proud; and therefore bold, because extremely faulty: and yet having no good thing to redeem both these and other unlovely parts but a little beauty, disgraced with wandering eyes and unweighed speeches. Yet had Pamphilus, for her, left Leucippe and withal, left his faith: Leucippe, of whom one look, in a clear judgement, would have been more acceptable than all her kindnesses so prodigally bestowed. For myself, the remembrance of his cruel handling Dido, joined to this, stirred me to seek some revenge upon him but that I thought it should be a gain to him to lose his life, being so matched: and therefore, leaving bim to be punished by his own election, we conveyed Leucippe to a house thereby, dedicated to Vestal nuns, where she resolved to spend all her years (which her youth promised should be many) in bewailing the wrong and yet praying for the wrong-doer.
   ‘But the next morning, we (having striven with the sun’s earliness) were scarcely beyond the prospect of the high turrets of that building, when there overtook us a young gentleman, for so he seemed to us: but indeed, sweet lady, it was the fair Zelmane, Plexirtus’ daughter, whom unconsulting affection (unfortunately bora to me-wards) had made borrow so much of her natural modesty as to leave her more-decent raiments, and taking occasion of Andromana’s tumultuous pursuing us, had apparelled herself like a page; with a pitiful cruelty cutting off her golden hair, leaving nothing but the short curls to cover that noble head, but that she ware upon it a fair headpiece; a shield at her back, and a lance in her hand, else disarmed. Her apparel of white wrought upon with broken knots; her horse fair and lusty, which she rid so as might show a fearful boldness, daring to do that which she knew that she knew not how to do: and the sweetness of her countenance did give such a grace to what she did that it did make handsome the unhandsomeness, and make the eye force the mind to believe that there was a praise in that unskilfulness.
   ‘But she straight approached me and with few words (which borrowed the help of her countenance to make themselves understood) she desired me to accept her into my service, telling me she was a nobleman's son of Iberia, her name Daiphantus who, having seen what I had done in that court, had stolen from her father to follow me. I enquired the particularities of the manner of Andromana’s following me, which by her I understood, she hiding nothing (but her sex) from me. And still methought I had seen that face, but the great alteration of her fortune made her far distant from my memory: but liking very well the young gentleman - such I took her to be - admitted this Daiphantus about me, who well showed there is no service like his that serves because he loves. For though bom of prince’s blood, brought up with tenderest education, unapt to service (because a woman) and full of thoughts (because in a strange estate) yet love enjoined such diligence that no apprentice - no, no bondslave could ever be by fear more ready at all commandments than that young princess was. How often, alas, did her eyes say unto me that they loved, and yet I, not looking for such a matter, had not my conceit open to understand them! How often would she come creeping to me, between gladness to be near me and fear to offend me! Truly I remember that then I marvelled to see her receive my commandments with sighs, and yet to do them with cheerfulness: sometimes answering me in such riddles as I then thought a childish inexperience, but since returning to my remembrance they have come more clear unto my knowledge. And pardon me, only dear lady, that I use many words, for her affection to me deserves of me an affectionate speech.
   ‘But in such sort did she serve me in that kingdom of Bithynia, for two months’ space; in which time we brought to good end a cruel war long maintained between the king of Bithynia and his brother. For my excellent cousin and I (dividing ourselves to either side) found means, after some trial we had made of ourselves, to get such credit with them as we brought them to as great peace between themselves as love towards us for having made the peace. Which done, we intended to return through the kingdom of Galatia towards Thrace, to ease the care of our father and mother who, we were sure, first with the shipwreck, and then with t e other dangers we daily passed, should have little rest in t eir thoughts till they saw us.
   'But we were not entered into that kingdom when, by the noise of a great fight, we were guided to a pleasant valley which, like one of those circuses which in great cities somewhere doth give a pleasant spectacle of running horses, so of either side, stretching itself in a narrow length, was it hemmed in by woody hills, as if indeed Nature had meant therein to make a place for beholders.
   And there we beheld one of the cruellest fights between two knights that ever hath adorned the most martial story, so as I must confess, a while we stood bewondered, another while delighted with the rare bravery thereof; till seeing such streams of blood as threatened a drowning of life, we galloped towards them to part them. But we were prevented by a dozen armed knights or rather villains, who, using this time of their extreme feebleness, all together set upon them. But common danger brake off particular discord so that, though with a dying weakness, with a lively courage they resisted, and by our help drave away or slew those murdering attempters: among whom we happed to take alive the principal. But going to disarm those two excellent knights, we found, with no less wonder to us than astonishment to themselves, that they were the two valiant, and indeed famous, brothers, Tydeus and Telenor, whose adventure - as afterwards we made that ungracious wretch confess - had thus fallen out.
   ‘After the noble prince Leonatus had by his father’s death succeeded in the kingdom of Galatia, he, forgetting all former injuries, had received that naughty Plexirtus into a strait degree of favour, his goodness being as apt to be deceived as the other's craft was to deceive; till by plain proof, finding that the ungrateful man went about to poison him, yet would not suffer his kindness to be overcome, not by justice itself; but calling him to him, used words to this purpose.
     ‘“Plexirtus,” said he, “this wickedness is found by thee. No good deeds of mine have been able to keep it down in thee. All men counsel me to take away thy life, likely to bring forth nothing but as dangerous, as wicked, effects. But I cannot find it in my heart, remembering what father’s son thou art. But since it is the violence of ambition which perchance pulls thee from thine own judgement, I will see whether the satisfying that may quiet the ill-working of thy spirits. Not far hence is the great city of Trebisond which, with the territory about it, anciently pertained unto this crown; now unjustly possessed, and as unjustly abused by those who have neither title to hold it, nor virtue to rule it. To the conquest of that for thyself I will lend thee force, and give thee my right. Go, therefore, and with less unnaturalness glut thy ambition there; and that done, if it be possible, learn virtue.”
   'Plexirtus, mingling forsworn excuses wih false-meant promises, gladly embraced the offer: and hastily sending back for those two brothers (who at that time were with us succouring the gracious queen Erona) by their virtue chiefly, if not only, obtained the conquest of that goodly dominion. Which indeed done by them gave them such an authority, that though he reigned, they in effect ruled, most men honouring them because they only deserved honour, and many thinking therein to please Plexirtus, considering how much he was bound unto them: while they likewise, with a certain sincere boldness of self-warranting friendship, accepted all openly and plainly, thinking nothing should ever by Plexirtus be thought too much in them, since all they were was his.
   ‘But he (who by the rules of his own mind could construe no other end of men’s doings but self-seeking) suddenly feared what they could do, and as suddenly suspected what they would do, and as suddenly hated them, as having both might and mind to do. But dreading their power, standing so strongly in their own valour and others' affection, he durst not take open way against them; and as hard it was to take a secret, they being so continually followed by the best and every way ablest of that region: and therefore used this devilish sleight which I will tell you, not doubting, most wicked man, to turn their own friendship, towards him to their own destruction. He (knowing that they well knew there was no friendship between him and the new king of Pontus, never since he succoured Leonatus and us, to his overthrow) gave them to understand that of late there had passed secret defiance between them, to meet privately at a place appointed. Which though not so fit a thing for men of their greatness, yet was his honour so engaged as he could not go back. Yet feigning to find himself weak by some counterfeit infirmity, the day drawing near, he requested each of them to go in his stead, making either of them swear to keep the matter secret, even each from other; delivering the self-same particularities to both, but that he told Tydeus the king would meet him in a blue armour, and Telenor that it was a black armour: and with wicked subtlety, as if it had been so appointed, caused Tydeus to take a black armour, and Telenor a blue; appointing them ways how to go so as he knew they should not meet till they came to the place appointed, where each had promised to keep silence, lest the king should discover it was not Plexirtus. And there in await had he laid those murderers, that who overlived the other should by them be dispatched; he not daring trust more than those with that enterprise, and yet thinking them too few till themselves by themselves were weakened.
   ‘This we learned chiefly by the chief of those way-beaters, after the death of those two worthy brothers whose love was no less than their valour: but well we might find much thereof by their pitiful lamentation, when they knew their mismeeting, and saw each other (in despite of the surgery we could do unto them) striving who should run fastest to the goal of death: each bewailing the other, and more dying in the other than in himself; cursing their own hands for doing, and their breasts for not sooner suffering; detesting their unfortunately-spent time in having served so ungrateful a tyrant, and accusing their folly in having believed he could faithfully love who. did not love faithfulness; wishing us to take heed how we placed our goodwill upon any other ground than proof of virtue, since length of acquaintance, mutual secrecies, nor height of benefits could bind a savage heart - no man being good to other that is not good in himself. Then, while any hope was, beseeching us to leave the care of him that besought, and only look to the other. But when they found by themselves, and us, no possibility, they desired to be joined; and so embracing and craving that pardon each of other which they denied to themselves, they gave us a most sorrowful spectacle of their death, leaving few in the world behind them their matches in anything, if they had soon enough known the ground and limits of friendship. But with woeful hearts we caused those bodies to be conveyed to the next town of Bithynia, where we learning thus much, as I have told you, caused the wicked historian to conclude his history with his own well-deserved death.'
   CHAPTER 23 
   But then, I must tell you, I found such woeful countenances in Daiphantus that I could not but much marvel (finding them continue beyond the first assault of pity) how the cause of strangers - for further I did not conceive - could so deeply pierce. But the truth indeed is that, partly with the shame and sorrow she took of her father’s faultiness, partly with the fear that the hate I conceived against him would utterly disgrace her in my opinion whensoever I should know her, so vehemently perplexed her, that her fair colour decayed, and daily and hastily grew into the very extreme working of sorrowfulness, which oft I sought to learn and help. But she, as fearful as loving, still concealed it; and so decaying still more and more in the excellency of her fairness, but that whatsoever weakness took away, pity seemed to add. Yet still she forced herself to wait on me with such care and diligence as might well show had been taught in no other school but love.
   ‘While we, returning again to embark ourselves for Greece, understood that the mighty Otanes (brother to Barzanes, slain by Musidorus in the battle of the six princes) had entered upon the kingdom of Pontus, partly upon the pretences he had to the crown, but principally because he would revenge upon him (whom he knew we loved) the loss of his brother, thinking (as indeed he had cause) that wheresoever we were, hearing of his extremity, we would come to relieve him. In spite whereof he doubted not to prevail, not only upon the confidence of his own virtue and power, but especially because he had in his company two mighty giants, sons to a couple whom we slew in the same realm. They (having been absent at their father’s death, and now returned) willingly entered into his service, hating more than he both us and that king of Pontus. We therefore with all speed went thitherward, but by the way this fell out which, whensoever I remember without sorrow, I must forget, withal, all humanity.
   ‘Poor Daiphantus fell extreme sick, yet would needs conquer the delicacy of her constitution and force herself to wait on me: till one day going towards Pontus, we met one who in great haste went seeking for Tydeus and Telenor, whose death as yet was not known unto the messenger; who (being their servant, and knowing how dearly they loved Plexirtus) brought them word how, since their departing, Plexirtus was in present danger of a cruel death, if by the valiantness of one of the best knights of the world he were not rescued. We inquired no further of the matter, being glad he should now to his loss find what an unprofitable treason it had been unto him to dismember himself of two such friends, and so let the messenger part, not sticking to make him know his masters’ destruction by the falsehood of Plexirtus.
   ‘But the grief of that (finding a body already brought to the last degree of weakness) so overwhelmed the little remnant of the spirits left in Daiphantus, that she fell suddenly into deadly swoundings; never coming to herself but that withal she returned to make most pitiful lamentations; most strange unto us, because we were far from guessing the ground thereof. But finding her sickness such as began to print death in her eyes, we made all haste possible to convey her to the next town: but before we could lay her on a bed, both we and she might find in herself that the harbingers of over-hasty death had prepared his lodging in that dainty body, which she undoubtedly feeling, with a weak cheerfulness showed comfort therein; and then desiring us both to come near her, and that nobody else might be present, with pale and yet (even in paleness) lovely lips:
    "Now or never, and never indeed but now is it time for me,” said she, “to speak: and I thank death which gives me leave to discover that, the suppressing whereof perchance hath been the sharpest spur that hath hasted my race to this end. Know then my lords, and especially you, my lord and master, Pyrocles, that your page Daiphantus is the unfortunate Zelmane, who for your sake caused my as unfortunate lover and cousin, Palladius, to leave his father’s court, and consequently both him and my aunt, his mother, to lose their lives. For your sake myself have become of a princess, a page, and for your sake have put off the apparel of a woman, and (if you judge not more mercifully) the modesty.”
   We were amazed at her speech, and then had, as it were, new eyes given us to perceive that which before had been a present stranger to our minds: for indeed we forthwith knew it to be the face of Zelmane, whom before we had known in the court of Iberia. And sorrow and pity laying her pain upon me, I comforted her the best I could by the tenderness of goodwill, pretending indeed better hope than I had of her recovery.
   ‘But she that had inward ambassadors from the tyrant that shortly would oppress her: “No, my dear master,” said she, “I neither hope nor desire to live. I know you would never have loved me,” and with that word she wept, “nor, alas, had it been reason you should, considering many ways my unworthiness. It sufficeth me that the strange course I have taken shall to your remembrance witness my love; and yet this breaking of my heart, before I would discover my pain, will make you, I hope, think that I was not altogether unmodest. Think of me so, dear master, and that thought shall be my life.” And with that, languishingly looking upon me, “And I pray you,” said she, "even by these dying eyes of mine (which are only sorry to die because they shall lose your sight) and by these polled locks o'; mine (which, while they were long, were the ornament of my sex, now in their short curls, the testimony of my servitude) and by the service I have done you (which God knows hath been full of love) think of me after my death with kindness, though you cannot with love. And whensoever you shall make any other lady happy with your well-placed affection, if you tell her my folly, I pray you speak of it, not with scorn, but with pity.”
   ‘I assure you (dear princess of my life, for how could it be otherwise?) her words and her manner, with the lively consideration of her love, so pierced me, that though I had divers griefs before, yet methought I never felt till then how much sorrow enfeebleth all resolution: for I could not choose but yield to the weakness of abundant weeping; in truth with such grief, that I could willingly at that time have changed lives with her.
   ‘But when she saw my tears, "O God,” said she, "how largely am I recompensed for my losses! Why then,” said she, "I may take boldness to make some requests unto you.”
   ‘I besought her to do, vowing the performance, though my life were the price thereof. She showed great joy.
   ‘ "The first,” said she, “is this, that you will pardon my father the displeasure you have justly conceived against him, and for this once succour him out of the danger wherein he is: I hope he will amend: and I pray you, whensoever you remember him to be the faulty Plexirtus, remember withal that he is Zelmane’s father. The second is, that when you come once into Greece, you will take unto yourself this name, though unlucky, of Daiphantus, and vouchsafe to be called by it; for so shall I be sure you shall have cause to remember me. And let it please your noble cousin to be called Palladius, that I may do that right to that poor prince, that his name yet may live upon the earth in so excellent a person: and so between you, I trust sometimes your unlucky page shall be, perhaps with a sigh, mentioned. Lastly, let me be buried here obscurely, not suffering my friends to know my fortune till, when you are safely returned to your own country, you cause my bones to be conveyed thither and laid. I beseech you, in some place where yourself vouchsafe sometimes to resort.”
   ‘Alas, small petitions for such a suitor; which yet she so earnestly craved that I was fain to swear the accomplishment. And then kissing me, and often desiring me not to condemn her of lightness, in mine arms she delivered her pure soul to the purest place, leaving me as full of agony as kindness, pity, and sorrow could make an honest heart For I must confess for true that if my stars had not wholly reserved me for you, there else perhaps. I might have loved, and - which had been most strange - begun my love after death: whereof let it be the less marvel, because somewhat she did resemble you, though as far short of your perfection as herself dying was of herself flourishing: yet something there was which, when I saw a picture of yours, brought again her figure into my remembrance, and made my heart as apt to receive the wound, as the power of your beauty with unresistible force to pierce.
   ‘But we, in woeful and yet private manner burying her, performed her commandment: and then, enquiring of her father's estate, certainly learned that he was presently to be succoured, or by death to pass the need of succour. Therefore we determined to divide ourselves; I (according to my vow) to help him, and Musidorus towards the king of Pontus, who stood in no less need than immediate succour: and even ready to depart one from the other, there came a messenger from him who after some inquiry found us, giving us to understand that he, trusting upon us two, had appointed the combat between him and us against Otanes and the two giants. Now the day was so accorded as it was impossible for me both to succour Plexirtus, and be there where my honour was not only so far engaged, but (by the strange working of unjust fortune) I was to leave the standing by Musidorus, whom better than myself I loved, to go save him whom for just causes I hated. But my promise given, and given to Zelmane, and to Zelmane dying, prevailed more with me than my friendship to Musidorus, though certainly I may affirm, nothing had so great rule in my thoughts as that But my promise carried me the easier, because Musidorus himself would not suffer me to break it. And so with heavy minds, more careful each of other’s success than of our own, we parted; I toward the place where I understood Plexirtus was prisoner to an ancient lord, absolutely governing a goodly castle, with a large territory about it whereof he acknowledged no other sovereign but himself; whose hate to Plexirtus grew for a kinsman of his whom he maliciously had murdered, because in the time that he reigned in Galatia he found him apt to practise for the restoring of his virtuous brother Leonatus.
   ‘This old knight, still thirsting for revenge, used as the way to it a policy which this occasion I will tell you prepared for him. Plexirtus in his youth had married Zelmane’s mother, who dying of that only childbirth, he, a widower and not yet a king, haunted the court of Armenia where (as he was cunning to win favour) he obtained great good liking of Artaxia, which he pursued; till, being called home by his father, he falsely got his father’s kingdom and then neglected his former love: till, thrown out of that by our means before he was deeply rooted in it, and by and by again placed in Trebisond, understanding that Artaxia by her brother's death was become queen of Armenia, he was hotter than ever in that pursuit.
   ‘Which being understood by this old knight, he forged such a letter as might be written from Artaxia, entreating his present (but very privy'') repair thither, giving him faithful promise of present marriage — a thing far from her thought, having faithfully and publicly protested that she would never marry any but some such prince who would give sure proof that by his means we were destroyed. But he (no more witty to frame than blind to judge hopes) bit hastily at the bait and in private manner posted towards her; but by the way he was met by this knight far better accompanied, who quickly laid hold of him and condemned him to a death, cruel enough, if anything may be both cruel and just For he caused him to be kept in a miserable prison till a day appointed, at which time he would deliver him to be devoured by a monstrous beast of most ugly shape, armed like a rhinoceros, as strong as an elephant, as fierce as a lion, as nimble as a leopard, and as cruel as a tiger; whom he, having kept in a strong place from the first youth of it, now thought no fitter match than such a beastly monster with a monstrous tyrant: proclaiming yet withal that if any so well loved him as to venture their lives against his beast for him, if they overcame, he should be saved: not caring how many they were, such confidence he had in that monster’s strength, but especially hoping to entrap thereby the great courages of Tydeus and Telenor, whom he no less hated because they had been principal instruments of the other's power.
   ‘I dare say, if Zelmane had known what danger I should have passed, she would rather have let her father perish thxn me to have bidden that adventure. But my word was passed; and truly the hardness of the enterprise was not so much a bit as a spur unto me, knowing well that the journey of high honour lies not in plain ways. Therefore going thither, and taking sufficient security that Plexirtus should be delivered if I were victorious, I undertook the combat: and to make short excellent lady, and not to trouble your ears with recounting a terrible matter, so was my weakness blessed from above that, without dangerous wounds, I slew that monster which hundreds durst not attempt; to so great admiration of many, who from a safe place might look on, that there was order given to have the fight, both by sculpture and picture, celebrated in most parts of Asia. And the old nobleman so well liked me that he loved me; only bewailing my virtue had been employed to save a worse monster than I killed, whom yet, according to faith given, he delivered; and accompanied me to the kingdom of Pontus whither I would needs in all speed go to see whether it were possible for me, if perchance the day had been delayed, to come to the combat But that, before I came, had been thus finished.
   
   
   
   The virtuous Leonatus, understanding two so good friends of his were to be in that danger, would perforce be one himself; where he did valiantly, and so did the king of Pontus. But the truth is that both they being sore hurt, the incomparable Musidorus finished the combat by the death of both the giants, and the taking of Otanes prisoner. To whom as he gave his life, so he got a noble friend, for so he gave his word to be, and he is well known to think himself greater in being subject to that than in the greatness of his principality.
   'But thither, understanding of our being there, flocked great multitudes of many great persons, and even of princes, especially those whom we had made beholding unto us: as, the kings of Phrygia, Bithynia, with those two hurt, of Pontus and Galatia, and Otanes, the prisoner by Musidorus set free; and thither came Plexirtus of Trebisond, and Antiphilus then king of Lycia; with as many mo great princes, drawn either by our reputation, or by willingness to acknowledge themselves obliged unto us for what we had done for the others. So as in those parts of the world, I think, in many hundreds of years there was not seen so royal an assembly, where nothing was let pass to do us the highest honours which such persons (who might command both purses and inventions) could perform: all from all sides bringing unto us right royal presents, which we (to avoid both unkindness and importunity) liberally received; and not content therewith, would needs accept, as from us, their crowns, and acknowledge to hold them of us: with many other excessive honours which would not suffer the measure of this short leisure to describe unto you.’
   CHAPTER 24
   'But we, quickly aweary thereof, hasted to Greece-ward, led thither partly with the desire of our parents, but hastened principally because I understood that Anaxius with open mouth of defamation had gone thither to seek me, and was now come to Peloponnesus, where from court to court he made enquiry of me, doing yet himself so noble deeds as might hap to authorize an ill opinion of me. We therefore suffered but short delays, desiring to take this country in our way, so renowned over the world that no prince could pretend height, nor beggar lowness, to bar him from the sound thereof: renowned indeed, not so much for the ancient praises attributed thereunto as for the having in it Argalus and Amphialus, two knights of such rare prowess as we desired especially to know; and yet by far not so much for that, as without suffering of comparison for the beauty of you and your sister, which makes all indifferent judges that speak thereof account this country as a temple of deities.
   'But these causes indeed moving us to come by this land, we embarked ourselves in the next port, whither all those princes (saving Antiphilus, who returned, as he pretended, not able to tarry longer from Erona) conveyed us. And there found we a ship most royally furnished by Plexirtus, who had made all things so proper, as well for our defence as ease, that all the other princes greatly commended him for it: who, seeming a quite altered man, had nothing but repentance in his eyes, friendship in his gesture, and virtue in his mouth; so that we, who had promised the sweet Zelmane to pardon him, now not only forgave but began to favour, persuading ourselves with a youthful credulity that perchance things were not so evil as we took them and, as it were, desiring our own memory that it might be so. But so were we licensed from those princes, truly not without tears, especially of the virtuous Leonatus who, with the king of Pontus, would have come with us but that we (in respect of the one’s young wife, and both their new settled kingdoms) would not suffer it. Then would they have sent whole fleets to guard us; but we, that desired to pass secretly into Greece, made them leave that motion when they found that more ships than one would be displeasing unto us. But so committing ourselves to the uncertain discretion of the wind, we (then determining as soon as we came to Greece to take the names of Daiphantus and Palladius, as well for our own promise to Zelmane as because we desired to come unknown into Greece) left the Asian shore full of princely persons, who even upon their knees recommended our safeties to the devotion of their chief desires; among whom none had been so officious (though I dare affirm, all quite contrary to his unfaithfulness) as Plexirtus.
   'And so having sailed almost two days, looking for nothing but when we might look upon the land, a grave man (whom we had seen of great trust with Plexirtus and was sent as our principal guide) came unto us and, with a certain kind manner mixed with shame and repentance, began to tell us that he had taken such a love unto us (considering our youth and fame) that though he were a servant, and a servant of such trust about Plexirtus as that he had committed unto him even those secrets of his heart which abhorred all other knowledge, yet he rather chose to reveal at this time a most pernicious counsel than by concealing it bring to ruin those whom he could not choose but honour. So went he on, and told us that Plexirtus (in hope thereby to have Artaxia, endowed with the great kingdom of Armenia, to his wife) had given him order, when we were near Greece to find some opportunity to murder us, bidding him to take us asleep, because he had seen what we could do waking.
   '"Now, Sirs,” said he, "I would rather a thousand times lose my life than have my remembrance, while I lived, poisoned with such a mischief; and therefore if it were only I that knew herein the king’s order, then should my disobedience be a warrant of your safety. But to one more,” said he, “namely the captain of the ship, Plexirtus hath opened so much touching the effect of murdering you, though I think laying the cause rather upon old grudge than his hope of Artaxia. And myself (before the consideration of your excellencies had drawn love and pity into mind) imparted it to such as I thought fittest for such a mischief. Therefore I wish you to stand upon your guard, assuring you that what I can do for your safety you shall see (if it come to the push) by me performed.”
   ‘We thanked him, as the matter indeed deserved, and from that time would no more disarm ourselves, nor the one sleep without his friend’s eyes waked for him; so that it delayed the going forward of their bad enterprise, while they thought it rather chance than providence which made us so behave ourselves.
   ‘But when we came within half a day’s sailing of the shore, so that they saw it was speedily, or not at all to be done, then - and I remember it was about the first watch in the night — came the captain and whispered the counsellor in the ear: but he, as it should seem, dissuading him from it, the captain (who had been a pirate from his youth, and often blooded in it) with a loud voice sware that if Plexirtus bade him, he would not stick to kill God himself. And therewith called his mates, and in the King’s name willed them to take us alive or dead, encouraging them with the spoil of us which he said (and indeed was true) would yield many exceeding rich jewels. But the counsellor, according to his promise, commanded them they should not commit such a villainy, protesting that he would stand between them and the king’s anger therein. Wherewith the captain, enraged, “Nay,” said he, “then we must begin with this traitor himself," and therewith gave him a sore blow upon the head, who honestly did the best he could to revenge himself.
   ‘But then we knew it time rather to encounter than wait for mischief. And so against the captain we went, who straight was environed with most part of the soldiers and mariners. And yet the truth is, there were some whom either the authority of the counsellor, doubt of the king’s mind, or liking of us, made draw their swords of our side, so that quickly it grew a most confused fight. For the narrowness of the place, the darkness of the time, and the uncertainty in such a tumult how to know friends from foes, made the rage of swords rather guide than be guided by their masters. For my cousin and me, truly I think we never performed less in any place, doing no other hurt than the defence of ourselves and succouring them who came for it drave us to: for not discerning perfectly who were for or against us, we thought it less evil to spare a foe than spoil a friend. But from the highest to the lowest part of the ship there was no place left without cries of murdering and murdered persons. The captain I happed a while to fight withal, but was driven to part with him by hearing the cry of the counsellor, who received a mortal wound, mistaken of one of his own side.
   ‘Some of the wiser would call to parley and wish peace; but while the words of peace were in their mouths, some of their evil auditors gave them death for their hire. So that no man almost could conceive hope of living but by being last alive; and therefore every one was willing to make himself room by dispatching almost any other: so that the great number in the ship was reduced to exceeding few, when of those few the most part, weary of those troubles, leapt into the boat which was fast to the ship; but while they that were first were cutting off the rope that tied it, others came leaping in so disorderly that they drowned both the boat and themselves.
   ‘But while even in that little remnant, like the children of Cadmus, we continued still to slay one another, a fire which (whether by the desperate malice of some, or intention to separate, or accidentally, while all things were cast up and down) it should seem had taken a good while before, but never heeded of us (who only thought to preserve or revenge) now violently burst out in many places and began to master the principal parts of the ship. Then necessity made us see that a common enemy sets at one a civil war; for that little all we were (as if we had been waged by one man to quench a fire) straight went to resist that furious enemy by all art and labour: but it was too late, for already it did embrace and devour from the stern to the waist of the ship; so as labouring in vain, we were driven to get up to the prow of the ship, by the work of nature seeking to preserve life as long as we could: while truly it was a strange and ugly sight to see so huge a fire, as it quickly grew to be, in the sea, and in the night, as if it had come to light us to death. And by and by it had burned off the mast, which all this while had proudly borne the sail (the wind, as might seem, delighted to carry fire and blood in his mouth) but now it fell overboard, and the fire growing nearer us, it was not only terrible in respect of what we were to attend, but insupportable through the heat of it.
   ‘So that we were constrained to bide it no longer, but disarming and stripping ourselves, and laying ourselves upon such things as we thought might help our swimming to the land (too far for our own strength to bear us) my cousin and I threw ourselves into the sea. But I had swum a very little way when I felt, by reason of a wound I had, that I should not be able to bide the travail; and therefore seeing the mast, whose tackling had been burnt off, float clear from the ship, I swam unto it, and getting on it, I found mine own sword which by chance, when I threw it away, caught by a piece of canvas, had hung to the mast. I was glad because I loved it well, but gladder, when I saw at the other end the captain of the ship and of all this mischief, who, having a long pike, belike had borne himself up with that till he had set himself upon the mast. But when I perceived him, “Villain,” said I, “dost thou think to over-live so many honest men whom thy falsehood hath brought to destruction?” With that, bestriding the mast, I got by little and little towards him after such a manner as boys are wont, if ever you saw that sport, when they ride the wild mare. And he, perceiving my intention, like a fellow that had much more courage than honesty, set himself to resist: but I had in short space gotten within him and, giving him a sound blow, sent him to feed fishes. But there myself remained, until by pirates I was taken up, and among them again taken prisoner and brought into Laconia.’
   ‘But what,' said Philoclea, ‘became of your cousin Musidorus?' ‘Lost,’ said Pyrocles.
   ‘Ah, my Pyrocles,' said Philoclea, ‘I am glad I have taken you. I perceive you lovers do not always say truly. As though I knew not your cousin Dorus the shepherdl'
   ‘Life of my desires,' said Pyrocles, ‘what is mine, even to my soul, is yours, but the secret of my friend is not mine. But if you know so much, then I may truly say, he is lost since he is no more his own. But I perceive your noble sister and you are great friends, and well doth it become you so to be.’
   ‘But go forward, dear Pyrocles, I long to hear out till your meeting me: for there to me-ward is the best part of your story.'
   ‘Ah sweet Philoclea,' said Pyrocles, ‘do you think I can think so precious leisure as this well spent in talking? Are your eyes a fit book, think you, to read a tale upon? Is my love quiet enough to be an historian? Dear princess, be gracious unto me.’
   And then he fain would have remembered to have forgot himself. But she, with a sweetly disobeying grace, desired him that her desire, once for ever, might serve, that no spot might disgrace that love which shortly she hoped should be to the world warrantable. Fain he would not have heard, till she threatened anger; and then the poor lover durst not, because he durst not.
   ‘Nay, I pray thee, dear Pyrocles,' said she, ‘let me have my story.’
   ‘Sweet princess,' said he, ‘give my thoughts a little respite: and if it please you, since this time must so be spoiled, yet it shall suffer the less harm if you vouchsafe to bestow your voice, and let me know how the good queen Erona was betrayed into such danger, and why Plangus sought me. For indeed I should pity greatly any mischance fallen to that princess.'
   ‘I will,’ said Philoclea, smiling, ‘so you give me your word your hands shall be quiet auditors.’
   ‘They shall,’ said he, ‘because subject.’
   Then began she to speak, but with so pretty and delightful a majesty, when she set her countenance to tell the matter, that Pyrocles could not choose but rebel so far as to kiss her. She would have pulled her head away and speak, but while she spake, he kissed, and it seemed he fed upon her words; but she gat away.
   ‘How will you have your discourse,’ said she, ‘without you let my lips alone?’
   He yielded, and tooK her hands. ‘On this,’ said he, ‘will I revenge my wrong’, and so began to make much of that hand, when her tale and his delight were interrupted by Miso who, taking her time while Basilius’ back was turned, came unto them, and told Philoclea she deserved she knew what for leaving her mother (being evil at ease) to keep company with strangers. But Philoclea telling her that she was there by her father’s commandment, she went away muttering that though her back and her shoulders and her neck were broken, yet as long as her tongue would wag, it should do her errand to her mother.
   CHAPTER 25
   And so went up Miso to Gynecia, who was at that time miserably vexed with this manner of dream. It seemed unto her to be in a place full of thorns, which so molested her as she could neither abide standing still nor tread safely going forward. In this case she thought Zelmane (being upon a fair hill, delightful to the eye and easy in appearance) called her thither; whither with much anguish being come, Zelmane was vanished and she found nothing but a dead body like unto her husband; which seeming at the first with a strange smell to infect her as she was ready likewise within a while to die, the dead body, she thought, took her in his arms and said, ‘Gynecia, leave all, for here is thy only rest.’
   With that she awaked, crying very loud, ‘Zelmane, Zelmane.’ But remembering herself, and seeing Basilius by (her guilty conscience more suspecting than being suspected) she turned her call and called for Philoclea. Miso forthwith like a valiant shrew, looking at Basilius as though she would speak though she died for it, told Gynecia that her daughter had been a whole hour together in secret talk with Zelmane. ‘And’ says she, ‘for my part I could not be heard, your daughters are brought up in such awe, though I told her of your pleasure sufficiently.’
   Gynecia, as if she had heard her last doom pronounced against her, with a side-look and changed countenance, ‘O my lord,’ said she, ‘what mean you to suffer those young folks together?’
   Basilius, that aimed nothing at the mark of her suspicion, smilingly took her in his arms: ‘Sweet wife,' said he, ‘I thank you for your care of your child; but they must be youths of other metal than Zelmane that can endanger her.’
   ‘O but - ,’ cried Gynecia, and therewith she stayed, for then indeed she did suffer a right conflict betwixt the force of love and rage of jealousy. Many times was she about to satisfy the spite of her mind, and tell Basilius how she knew Zelmane to be far otherwise than the outward appearance. But those many times were all put back by the manifold objections of her vehement love. Fain she would have barred her daughter's hap, but loth she was to cut off her own hope. But now, as if her lif had been set upon a wager of quick rising, as weak as she was, she gat up; though Basilius (with a kindness flowing only from the fountain of unkindness, being indeed desirous to win his daughter as much time as might be) was loth to suffer it, swearing he saw sickness in her face, and therefore was loth she should adventure the air.
   But the great and wretched lady Gynecia, possessed with those devils of love and jealousy, did rid herself from her tedious husband: and taking nobody with her, going towards them: ‘O jealousy,’ said she, ‘the frenzy of wise folks, the well-wishing spite and unkind carefulness; the self-punishment for other’s fault and self-misery in other’s happiness; the cousin of envy, daughter of love, and mother of hate, how could’st thou so quietly get thee a seat in the unquiet heart of Gynecia - Gynecia,’said she sighing, ‘thought wise and once virtuous? Alas, it is thy breeder’s power which plants thee there: it is the flaming agony of affection that works the chilling access of thy fever, in such sort that nature gives place: the growing of my daughter seems the decay of myself; the blessings of a mother turn to the curses of a competitor, and the fair face of Philoclea appears more horrible in my sight than the image of death.'
   Then remembered she this song, which she thought took a right measure of her present mind:
With two strange fires of equal heat possessed,
       The one of love, the other jealousy;
Both still do work, in neither find I rest:
       For both, alas, their strengths together tie:
The one aloft doth hold the other high.
       Love wakes the jealous eye, lest thence it moves:
       The jealous eye, the more it looks, it loves.

These fires increase; in these I daily bum;
       They feed on me, and with my wings do fly:
My lively joys to doleful ashes turn:
       Their flames mount up, my powers prostrate lie;
They live in force; I quite consumed die.
       One wonder yet far passes my conceit:
   The fuel small; how be the fires so great?
   But her unleisured thoughts ran not over the ten first words; but going with a pace not so much too fast for her body as slow for her mind, she found them together, who after Miso’s departure had left their tale and determined what to say to Basilius. But full abashed was poor Philoclea (whose conscience now began to know cause of blushing) for first salutation receiving an eye from her mother full of the same disdainful scorn which Pallas showed to poor Arachne that durst contend with her for the prize of well weaving: yet did the force of love so much rule her that, though for Zelmane's sake she did detest her, yet for Zelmane s sake she used no harder words to her than to bid her go home and accompany her solitary father.
   Then began she to display to Zelmane the store-house of her deadly desires; when suddenly the confused rumour of a mutinous multitude gave just occasion to Zelmane to break off any such conference (for well she found they were not friendly voices they heard) and to retire with as much diligence as conveniently they could towards the lodge. Yet before they could win the lodge by twenty paces, they were overtaken by an unruly sort of clowns and other rebels which, like a violent flood, were carried they themselves knew not whither. But as soon as they came within perfect discerning these ladies, like enraged beasts, without respect of their estates or pity of their sex, they began to ruu against them, as right villains thinking ability to do hurt to be a great advancement; yet so many as they were, so many almost were their minds, all knit together only in madness. Some cried ‘Take’; some ‘Kill’; some, ‘Save’; but even they that cried ‘Save’ ran for company with them that meant to kill. Everyone commanded; none obeyed; he only seemed chief captain that was most rageful.
   Zelmane, whose virtuous courage was ever awake, drew out her sword, which upon those ill-armed churls giving as many wounds as blows, and as many deaths almost as wounds, lightning courage and thundering smart upon them, kept them at a bay, while the two ladies got themselves into the lodge, out of the which Basilius (having put on an armour long untried) came to prove his authority among his subjects, or at least to adventure his life with his dear mistress to whom he brought a shield, while the ladies tremblingly attended the issue of this dangerous adventure. But Zelmane made them perceive the odds between an eagle and a kite, with such a nimble steadiness and such an assured nimbleness that while one was running back for fear, his fellow had her sword in his guts.
   And by and by was both her heart and help well increased by the coming in of Dorus who, having been making of hurdles for his master’s sheep, heard the horrible cries of this mad multitude; and having straight represented before the eyes of his careful love the peril wherein the soul of his soul might be, he went to Pamela’s lodge, but found her in a cave hard by, with Mopsa and Dametas, who at that time would not have opened the entry to his father. And therefore leaving them there as in a place safe, both for being strong and unknown, he ran as the noise guided him. But when he saw his friend in such danger among them, anger and contempt (asking no counsel but of courage) made him run among them with no other weapon but his sheep-hook, and with that overthrowing one of the villains, took away a two-hand sword from him, and withal helped him from ever being ashamed of losing it. Then lifting up his brave head, and flashing terror into their faces, he made arms and legs go complain to the earth how evil their masters had kept them. Yet the multitude still growing and the very killing wearying them, fearing lest in long fight they should be conquered with conquering, they drew back toward the lodge; but drew back in such sort that still their terror went forward; like a valiant mastiff, whom when his master pulls back by the tail from the bear with whom he hath already interchanged a hateful embracement, though his pace be backward, his gesture is forward, his teeth and eyes threatening more in the retiring than they did in the advancing: so guided they themselves homeward, never stepping step backward but that they proved themselves masters of the ground where they stepped.
   Yet among the rebels there was a dapper fellow, a tailor by occupation who, fetching his courage only from their going back, began to bow his knees, and very fencer-like to draw near to Zelmane. But as he came within her distance, turning his sword very nicely about his crown, Basilius, with a side blow, strake off his nose. He (being a suitor to a seamster’s daughter, and therefore not a little grieved for such a disgrace) stooped down, because he had heard that if it were fresh put to, it would cleave on again. But as his hand was on the ground to bring his nose to his head, Zelmane with a blow sent his head to his nose. That saw a butcher, a butcherly chuff indeed (who that day was sworn brother to him in a cup of wine) and lifted up a great leaver, calling Zelmane all the vile names of a butcherly eloquence. But she, letting slip the blow of the leaver, hit him so surely upon the side of the face that she left nothing but the nether jaw, where the tongue still wagged, as willing to say more if his master's remembrance had served. ‘O,’ said a miller that was half drunk, ‘see the luck of a good-fellow/ and with that word ran with a pitchfork at Dorus; but the nimbleness of the wine carried his head so fast that it made it over-run his feet, so that he fell withal just between the legs of Dorus, who, setting his foot on his neck (though he offered two milch kine and four fat hogs for his life) thrust his sword quite through from one ear to the other; which took it very unkindly, to feel such news before they heard of them, instead of hearing, to be put to such feeling. But Dorus, leaving the miller to vomit his soul out in wine and blood, with his two-hand sword strake off another quite by the waist who the night before had dreamed he was grown a couple, and, interpreting it that he should be married, had bragged of his dream that morning among his neighbours. But that blow astonished quite a poor painter who stood by with a pike in his hands. This painter was to counterfeit the skirmish between the Centaurs and Lapithes, and had been very desirous to see some notable wounds, to be able the more lively to express them; and this morning, being carried by the stream of this company, the foolish fellow was even delighted to see the effect of blows. But this last, happening near him, so amazed him that he stood stock still, while Dorus, with a turn of his sword, strake off both his hands. And so the painter returned well skilled in wounds, but with never a hand to perform his skill.
   CHAPTER 26
   In this manner they recovered the lodge, and gave the rebels a face of wood of the outside. But they then (though no more furious, yet more courageous when they saw no resister) went about with pickaxe to the wall and fire to the gate to get themselves entrance. Then did the two ladies mix fear with love - especially Philoclea, who ever caught hold of Zelmane, so (by the folly of love) hindering the succour which she desired. But Zelmane seeing no way of defence nor time to deliberate (the number of those villains still increasing, and their madness still increasing with their number) thought it only the means to go beyond their expectation with an unused boldness and with danger to avoid danger, and therefore opened again the gate; and Dorus and Basilius standing ready for her defence, she issued again among them. The blows she had dealt before, though all in general were hasty, made each of them in particular take breath before they brought them suddenly over-near her, so that she had time to get up to the judgement-seat of the prince which, according to the guise of that country, was before the court gate. There she paused a while, making sign with her hand unto them and, withal, speaking aloud that she had something to say unto them that would please them. But she was answered a while with nothing but shouts and cries, and some beginning to throw stones at her, not daring to approach her.
   But at length a young farmer (who might do most among the country sort and was caught in a little affection towards Zelmane) hoping by this kindness to have some good of her, desired them if they were honest men to hear the woman speak.
   ‘Fie fellows, fie,' said he, ‘what will all the maids in our town say if so many tall men shall be afraid to hear a fair wench? I swear unto you by no lif tie ones, I had rather give my team of oxen than we should show ourselves so uncivil wights. Besides, I tell you true, I have heard it of old men counted wisdom to hear much and say little.’
   His sententious speech so prevailed that the most part began to listen. Then she (with such efficacy of gracefulness and such a quiet magnanimity represented in her face in this uttermost peril as the more the barbarous people looked, the more it fixed their looks upon her) in this sort began unto them:
   ‘It is no small comfort unto me,’ said she, ‘having to speak something unto you for your own behoofs, to find that I have to deal with such a people who show indeed in themselves the right nature of valour, which, as it leaves no violence unattempted while the choler is nourished with resistance, so, when the subject of their wrath doth of itself unlooked-for offer itself into their hands, it makes them at least take a pause before they determine cruelty. Now then first (before I come to the principal matter) have I to say unto you that your prince Basilius himself in person is within this lodge, and was one of the three whom a few of you went about to fight withal; and’ (this she said, not doubting but they knew it well enough, but because she would have them imagine that the prince might think that they did not know it) ‘by him am I sent unto you as from a prince to his well-approved subjects, nay as from a father to beloved children, to know what it is that hath bred just quarrel among you, or who they be that have any way wronged you; what it is with which you are displeased or of which you are desirous. This he requires, and indeed (for he knows your faithfulness) he commands you presently to set down and choose among yourselves someone who may relate your griefs or demands unto him.'
   This (being more than they hoped for from their prince) assuaged well their fury, and many of them consented, especially the young farmer helping on, who meant to make one of the demands that he might have Zelmane for his wife. But when they began to talk of their griefs, never bees made such a confused humming: the town dwellers demanding putting down of imposts; the country fellows, laying out of commons: some would have the prince keep his court in one place, some in another. All cried out to have new counsellors, but when they should think of any new, they liked them as well as any other that they could remember: especially they would have the treasure so looked unto as that he should never need to take any more subsidies. At length they fell to direct contrarieties. For the artisans, they would have com and wine set at a lower price, and bound to be kept so still: the ploughmen, vine-labourers and farmers would none of that The countrymen demanded that every man might be free in the chief towns: that could not the burgesses like of. The peasants would have all the gentlemen destroyed; the citizens (especially such as cooks, barbers, and those other that lived most on gentlemen) would but have them reformed. And of each side were like divisions, one neighbourhood beginning to find fault with another.
   But no confusion was greater than of particular men’s likings and dislikings: one dispraising such a one whom another praised, and demanding such a one to be punished whom the other would have exalted. No less ado was there about choosing him who should be their spokesman. The finer sort of burgesses, as merchants, prentices and cloth-workers, because of their riches disdaining the baser occupations, and they because of their number as much disdaining them; all they scorning the countrymen's ignorance, and the countrymen suspecting as much their cunning: so that Zelmane (finding that their united rage was now grown not only to a dividing but to a crossing of one another, and that the mis like grown among themselves did well allay the heat against her) made tokens again unto them (as though she took great care of their well-doing and were afraid of their falling out) that she would speak unto them. They now, grown jealous one of another (the stay having engendered division and division having manifested their weakness) were willing enough to hear, the most part striving to show themselves willinger than their fellows: which Zelmane (by the acquaintance she had had with such kind of humours) soon perceiving, with an angerless bravery and an unabashed mildness, in this manner spake unto them.
   ‘An unused thing it is, and I think not heretofore seen, O Arcadians, that a woman should give public counsel to men, a stranger to the country people, and that lastly in such a presence, by a private person the regal throne should be possessed. But the strangeness of your action makes that used for virtue which your violent necessity imposeth. For certainly, a woman may well speak to such men who have forgotten all man-like government; a stranger may with reason instruct such subjects that neglect due points of subjection; and is it marvel this place is entered into by another, since your own prince, after thirty years’ government, dare not show his face unto his faithful people? Hear therefore, O Arcadians, and be ashamed
   ‘Against whom hath this zealous rage been stirred? Whither have been bent these manful weapons of yours? In this quiet harmless lodge there be harboured no Argians, your ancient enemies, nor Laconians, your now feared neighbours. Here be neither hard landlords nor biting usurers. Here lodge none but such as either you have great cause to love or no cause to hate: here being none, besides your prince, princess, and their children, but myself. Is it I then, O Arcadians, against whom your anger is armed? Am I the mark of your vehement quarrel? If it be so that innocency shall not be a stop for fury; if it be so that the law of hospitality (so long and holily observed among you) may not defend a stranger fled to your arms for succour; if, in fine, it be so that so many valiant men’s courages can be inflamed to the mischief of one silly woman, I refuse not to make my life a sacrifice to your wrath. Exercise on me your indignation, so it go no further: I am content to pay the great favours I have received among you with my life, not ill-deserving: I present it here unto you, O Arcadians, if that may satisfy you, rather than you (called over the world the wise and quiet Arcadians) should be so vain as to attempt that alone which all the rest of your country will abhor; than you should show yourselves so ungrateful as to forget the fruit of so many years’ peaceable government, or so unnatural as not to have with the holy name of your natural prince any fury overmastered. For such a hellish madness, I know, did never enter into your hearts as to attempt anything against his person; which no successor (though never so hateful) will ever leave (for his own sake) unrevenged.
   ‘Neither can your wonted valour be turned to such a baseness, as instead of a prince, delivered unto you by so many royal ancestors, to take the tyrannous yoke of your fellow subject, in whom the innate meanness will bring forth ravenous covetousness, and the newness of his estate, suspectful cruelty. Imagine, what could your enemies more wish unto you than to see your own estate with your own hands undermined? O what would your forefathers say if they lived at this time, and saw their offspring defacing such an excellent principality, which they with much labour and blood so wisely have established? Do you think them fools, that saw you should not enjoy your vines, your cattle, no not your wives and children without government? And that there could be no government without a magistrate, and no magistrate without obedience, and no obedience where everyone upon his own private passion may interpret the doings of the rulers? Let your wits make your present example a lesson to you. What sweetness, in good faith, find you in your present condition? What choice of choice find you, if you had lost Basilius? Under whose ensign would you go, if your enemies should invade you? If you cannot agree upon one to speak for you, how will you agree upon one to fight for you? But with this fear of I cannot tell what, one is troubled, and with that past wrong, another is grieved. And I pray you did the sun ever bring you a fruitful harvest but that it was more hot than pleasant? Have any of you children that be not sometimes cumbersome? Have any of you fathers that be not sometimes wearish? What, shall we curse the sun, hate our children, or disobey our fathers? - but what need I use these words, since I see in your countenances, now virtuously settled, nothing else but love and duty to him by whom for your only sakes the government is embraced. For all what is done, he doth not only pardon you but thank you, judging the action by the minds and not the minds by the action. Your griefs and desires, whatsoever and whensoever you list, he will consider of, and to his consideration it is reason you should refer them. So then, to conclude: the uncertainty of his estate made you take arms. Now you see him well, with the same love lay them down. If now you end, as I know you will, he will make no other account of this matter but as of a vehement, I must confess, over vehement affection: the only continuance might prove a wickedness. But it is not so, I see very well; you began with zeal and will end with reverence.
   The action Zelmane used, being beautified by nature and apparelled with skill; her gestures being such that, as her words did paint out her mind, so they served as a shadow to make the picture more lively and sensible; with the sweet clearness of her voice rising and falling kindly as the nature of the word and efficacy of the matter required - all together in such an admirable person (whose incomparable valour they had well felt, whose beauty did pierce through the thick dulness of their senses) gave such a way unto her speech through the rugged wilderness of their imaginations (who, besides they were stricken in admiration of her as of more than a human creature, were cooled with taking breath and had learned doubts out of leisure), that instead of roaring cries there was now heard nothing but a confused muttering whether her saying were to be followed, betwixt fear to pursue, and loathness to leave. Most of them could have been content it had never been begun, but how to end it (each afraid of his companion) they knew not, finding it far easier to tie than to loose knots. But Zelmane thinking it no evil way in such mutinies to give the mutinous some occasion of such service as they might think, in their own judgement, would countervail their trespass, withal to take the more assured possession of their minds which she feared might begin to waver:
   ‘Loyal Arcadians,’ said she, ‘now do I offer unto you the manifesting of your duties. All those that have taken arms for the prince’s safety, let them turn their back to the gate, with their weapons bent against such as would hurt his sacred person.’
   ‘O weak trust of the many-headed multitude whom inconstancy only doth guide to well-doing! Who can set confidence there where company takes away shame, and each may lay the fault bn his fellow?' - so said a crafty fellow among them, named Clinias, to himself, when he saw the word no sooner out of Zelmane’s mouth but that there were some shouts of joy, with, ‘God save Basilius,’ and divers of them with much jollity grown to be his guard that but little before meant to be his murderers.
   CHAPTER 27
   This Clinias in his youth had been a scholar so far as to learn rather words than manners, and of words rather plenty than order; and oft had used to be an actor in tragedies, where he had learned (besides a slidingness of language) acquaintance with many passions and to frame his face to bear the figure of them; long used to the eyes and ears of men, and to reckon no fault but shamefastness: in nature a most notable coward, and yet more strangely than rarely venturous in privy practices.
   This fellow was become of near trust to Cecropia, Amphialus’ mother, so that he was privy to all the mischievous devices wherewith she went about to ruin Basilius and his children, for the advancing of her son; and though his education had made him full of tongue, yet his love to be doing taught him in any evil to be secret, and had by his mistress been used, (ever since the strange retiring of Basilius), to whisper rumours into the people's ears: and this time, finding great aptness in the multitude, was one of the chief that set them in the uproar, though quite without the consent of Amphialus, who would not for all the kingdoms of the world so have adventured the life of Philoclea. But now perceiving the flood of their fury begun to ebb, he thought it policy to take the first of the tide, so that no man cried louder than he upon Basilius. And some of the lustiest rebels not yet agreeing to the rest, he caused two or three of his mates that were at his commandment to lift him up, and then as if he had had a prologue to utter, he began with a nice gravity to demand audience. But few attending what he said, with vehement gesture as if he would tear the stars from the skies, he fell to crying out so loud that not only Zelmane but Basilius might hear him:
   ‘O unhappy men, more mad than the giants that would have plucked Jupiter out of heaven, how long shall this rage continue? Why do you not all throw down your weapons and submit yourselves to our good prince, our good Basilius, the Pelops of wisdom and Minos of all good government? When will you begin to believe me, and other honest and faithful subjects, that have done all we could to stop your fury?’
   The farmer that loved Zelmane could abide him no longer. For as at the first he was willing to speak of conditions, hoping to have gotten great sovereignties (and among the rest Zelmane) so now, perceiving that the people, once anything down the hill from their fury, would never stay till they came to the bottom of absolute yielding and so that he should be nearer fears of punishment than hopes of such advancement, he was one of them that stood most against the agreement: and to begin withal, disdaining this fellow should play the preacher who had been one of the chiefest make- bates, strake him a great wound upon the face with his sword. The cowardly wretch fell down, crying for succour and, scrambling through the legs of them that were about him, got to the throne, where Zelmane took him and comforted him, bleeding for that was past and quaking for fear of more.
   But as soon as that blow was given, as if Aeolus had broke open the door to let all his winds out, no hand was idle, each one killing him that was next for fear he should do as much to him.
   For being divided in minds and not divided in companies, they that would yield to Basilius were intermingled with them that would not yield: these men thinking their ruin stood upon it; those men to get favour of their prince converted their ungracious motion into their own bowels, and by a true judgement grew their own punishers. None was sooner killed than those that had been leaders in the disobedience who, by being so, had taught them that they did lead, disobedience to the same leaders. And many times it fell out that they killed them that were of their own faction, anger whetting and doubt hastening their fingers. But then came down Zelmane, and Basilius with Dorus issued; and sometimes seeking to draw together those of their party, sometimes laying indifferently among them, made such havoc (among the rest Zelmane striking the farmer to the heart vith her sword, as before she had done with her eyes) that in a while they of the contrary side were put to flight and fled to certain woods upon the frontiers, where feeding wildly and drinking only water, they were disciplined for their drunken riots; many of them being slain in the chase, about a score only escaping. But when these late rebels, now soldiers, were returned from the chase, Basilius, calling them together partly for policy’s sake but principally because Zelmane before had spoken it (which was to him more than a divine ordinance) he pronounced their general pardon, willing them to return to their houses and thereafter be more circumspect in their proceedings, which they did, most of them with sharp marks of their folly. But imagining Clinias to be one of the chief that had bred this good alteration, he gave him particular thanks, and withal willed him to make him know how this frenzy had entered into the people.
   Clinias purposing indeed to tell him the truth of all, saving what did touch himself or Cecropia, first dipping his hand in the blood of his wound:
   ‘Now by this blood/ said he, ‘which is more dear to me than all the rest that is in my body, since it is spent for your safety: this tongue (perchance unfortunate, but never false) shall not now begin to lie unto my prince, of me most beloved.'
   Then stretching out his hand, and making vehement countenances the ushers to his speeches, in such manner of terms recounted this accident‘Yesterday,’ said he,‘being your birth-day, in the goodly green two mile hence before the city of Enispus, to do honour to the day were a four or five thousand people, of ail conditions, as I think, gathered together, spending all the day in dancings and other exercises, and when night came, under tents and boughs making great cheer, and meaning to observe a was- sailling watch all that night for your sake. Bacchus, the learned say, was begot with thunder:  think that made him ever since so full of stir and debate. Bacchus indeed it was which sounded the first trumpet to this rude alarum. For that barbarous opinion being generally among them, to think with vice to do honour and with activity in beastliness to show abundance of love, made most of them seek to show the depth of their affection in the depth of their draught. But being once well chafed with wine, having spent all the night and some piece of the morning in such revelling, and emboldened by your absented manner of living, there was no matter their ears had ever heard of that grew not to be a subject of their winey conference. I speak it by proof: for I take witness of the gods, who never leave perjuries unpunished, that I often cried out against their impudency and, when that would not serve, stopped mine ears because I would not be partaker of their blasphemies, till with buffets they forced me to have mine ears and eyes defiled. Public affairs were mingled with private grudges; neither was any man thought of wit that did not pretend some cause of mislike. Railing was counted the fruit of freedom, and saying nothing had his uttermost praise in ignorance.
   ‘At the length, your sacred person (Alas, why did I live to hear itl Alas, how do I breathe to utter it! But your commandment doth not only enjoin obedience but give me force) your sacred person, I say, fell to be their table-talk; a proud word swelling in their stomachs, and disdainful reproaches against so great a greatness having put on the show of greatness in their little minds: till at length the very unbridled use of words having increased fire in their minds (which, God wot, thought their knowledge notable, because they had at all no knowledge to condemn their own want of knowledge) they descended (O never to be forgotten presumption!) to a direct mislike of your living from among them. Whereupon it were tedious to remember their far-fetched constructions. But the sum was, you disdained them: and what were the pomps of your estate if their arms maintained you not? Who would call you a prince if you had not a people? When certain of them of wretched estates and worse minds, whose fortunes change could not impair, began to say that your government was to be looked into; how the great treasures you had levied among them had been spent; why none but great men and gentlemen could be admitted into counsel; that the commons, forsooth, were too plainheaded to say their opinions, but yet their blood and sweat must maintain all. Who could tell whether you were not betrayed in this place where you lived, nay, whether you did live or no? Therefore that it was time to come and see; and if you were here, to know (if Arcadia were grown loathsome in your sight) why you did not rid yourself of the trouble: there would not want those that would take so fair a cumber in good part. Since the country was theirs, and the government an adherent to the country, why should they not consider of the one as well as inhabit the other? “Nay rather,” said they, "let us begin that which all Arcadia will follow. Let us deliver our prince from danger of practices, and ourselves from want of a prince. Let us do that which all the rest think. Let it be said that we only are not astonished with vain titles which have their force but in our force.” ‘Lastly, to have said and heard so much was as dangerous as to have attempted; and to attempt they had the glorious name of liberty with them. These words, being spoken, like a furious storm presently carried away their well inclined brains. What I and some other of the honester sort could do was no more than if with a puff of breath one should go about to make a sail go against a mighty wind, or, with one hand, stay the ruin of a mighty wall. So general grew this madness among them, there needed no drum, where each man cried, each spake to other that spake as fast to him, and the disagreeing sound of so many voices was the chief token of their unmeet agreement. Thus was their banquet turned to a battle, their winey mirths to bloody rages, and the happy prayers for your life to monstrous threatening of your estate; the solemnizing your birth-day tended to have been the cause of your funeral.
   But as a drunken rage hath, besides his wickedness, that folly, that the more it seeks to hurt the less it considers how to be able to hurt, they never weighed how to arm themselves, but took up everything for a weapon that fury offered to their hands. Many swords, pikes, and bills there were; others took pitchforks and rakes, converting husbandry to soldiery: some caught hold of spits, things serviceable for life, to be the instruments of death. And there was some such one who held the same pot wherein he drank to your health to use it, as he could, to your mischief. Thus armed, thus governed, forcing the unwilling and heartening the willing, adding fury to fury and increasing rage with running, they came headlong toward this lodge: no man, I dare say, resolved in his own heart what was the uttermost he would do when he came hither.
   ‘But as mischief is of such nature that it cannot stand but with strengthening one evil by another, and so multiply in itself till it came to the highest and then fall with his own weight; so to their minds once past the bounds of obedience, more and more wickedness opened itself, so that they who first pretended to preserve you, then to reform you (I speak it in my conscience and with a bleeding heart) now thought no safety for them without murdering you. So as if the gods (who preserve you for the preservation of Arcadia) had not showed their miraculous power, and that they had not used for instruments both your own valour (not fit to be spoken of by so mean a mouth as mine) and some, I must confess, honest minds (whom, alas, why should I mention, since what we did reached not to the hundredth part of our duty?) our hands (I tremble to think of it) had destroyed all that for which we have cause to rejoice that we are Arcadians.’
   With that the fellow did wring his hands, and wrung out tears, so as Basilius, that was not the sharpest piercer into masked minds, took a good liking to him; and so much the more as he had tickled him with praise in the hearing of his mistress. And therefore pitying his wound, willed him to get him home and look well into it, and make the best search he could to know if there were any further depth in this matter, for which he should be well rewarded. But before he went away, certain of the shepherds being come (for that day was appointed for their pastorals) he sent one of them to Philanax and another to other principal noblemen and cities thereabouts, to make thorough inquiry of this uproar, and withal to place such garrisons in all the towns and villages near unto him, that he might thereafter keep his solitary lodge in more security, upon the making of a nre or ringing of a bell, having them in a readiness for him.
   CHAPTER 28
   This, Clinias (having his ear one way when his eye was another) had perceived, and therefore hasted away with mind to tell Cecropia she was to take some speedy resolution, or else it were danger those examinations would both discover and ruin her; and so went his way, leaving that little company with embracements and praising of Zelmane’s excellent proceeding, to show that no decking sets forth anything so much as affection. For as (while she stood at the discretion of those undiscreet rebels) every angry countenance any of them made seemed a knife laid upon their own throats, so unspeakable was now their joy that they saw (besides her safety and their own) the same wrought, and safely wrought by her means in whom they had placed all their delights. What examples Greece could ever allege of wit and fortitude were set in the rank of trifles, being compared to this action.
   But as they were in the midst of those unfeigned ceremonies, a gittem ill-played on, accompanied with a hoarse voice (who seemed to sing maugre the Muses and to be merry in spite of fortune) made them look the way of the ill-noised song. The song was this:
A hateful cure with hate to heal:
       A bloody help with blood to save:
A foolish thing with fools to deal.
       Let him be bob’d, that bobs will have.
       But who by means of wisdom high 
       Hath sav'd his charge? It is even I.

Let others deck their pride with scars,
       And of their wounds make brave lame shows;
First let them die, then pass the stars,
       When rotten fame will tell their blows:
       But eye from blade, and ear from cry,
       Who hath sav’d all? It is even L
   They had soon found it was Dametas, who came with no less lifted up countenance than if he had passed over the bellies of all his enemies; so wise a point he thought he had performed in using the natural strength of the cave. But never was it his doing to come so soon thence till the coast were more assuredly clear, for it was a rule with him that after a great storm there ever fall a few drops before it be fully finished. But Pamela, who had now experienced how much care doth solicit a lover's heart, used this occasion of going to her parents and sister, indeed as well for that cause, as being unquiet till her eye might be assured how her shepherd had gone through the danger.
   But Basilius with the sight of Pamela (of whom almost his head, otherwise occupied, had left the wonted remembrance) was suddenly stricken into a devout kind of admiration, remembering the oracle, which, according to the fawning humour of false hope, he interpreted now his own to his own best, and with the willing blindness of affection (because his mind ran wholly upon Zelmane) he thought the gods in their oracles did principally mind her.
   But as he was thinking deeply of the matter, one of the shepherds told him that Philanax was already come with a hundred horse in his company. For having by chance rid not far off the little desert, he had heard of this uproar, and so was come upon the spur, gathering a company of gentlemen as fast as he could, to the succour of his master. Basilius was glad of it; but not willing to have him, nor any other of the noblemen, see his mistress, he himself went out of the lodge: and so giving order unto him of placing garrisons and examining those matters; and Philanax with humble earnestness beginning to entreat him to leave off this solitary course which already had been so dangerous unto him: “Well,’ said Basilius, ‘it may be ere long I will condescend unto your desire. In the meantime, take you the best order you can to keep me safe in my solitariness. But,’ said he, ‘do you remember how earnestly you wrote unto me that I should not be moved by that oracle’s authority which brought me to this resolution?’
   ‘Full well, Sir,’ answered Philanax, ‘for though it pleased you not as then to let me know what the oracle’s words were, yet all oracles holding, in my conceit, one degree of reputation, it sufficed me to know it was but an oracle which led you from your own course.’
   ‘Well,’ said Basilius, ‘I will now tell you the words, which before I thought not good to do, because when all the events fall out, as some already have done, I may charge you with your incredulity.’ So he repeated them in this sort:
Thy elder care shall from thy careful face 
       By princely mean be stolen, and yet not lost 
Thy younger shall with Nature’s bliss embrace 
       An uncouth love, which Nature hateth most.
Both they themselves unto such two shall wed,
       Who at thy bier, as at a bar, shall plead 
Why thee (a living man) they had made dead.
       In thine own seat a foreign state shall sit.
       And ere that all these blows thy head do hit,
       Thou, with thy wife adultery shall commit.
   ‘For you, forsooth,’ said he, ‘when I told you that some supernatural cause sent me strange visions, which being confirmed with presagious chances, I had gone to Delphos and there received this answer; you replied to me that the only supernatural causes were the humours of my body which bred such melancholy dreams, and that both they framed a mind full of conceits, apt to make presages of things which in themselves were merely chanceable: and withal, as I say, you remember what you wrote unto me touching the authority of the oracle: but now I have some notable trial of the truth thereof, which hereafter I will more largely communicate unto you. Only now, know that the thing I most feared is already performed - I mean, that a foreign state should possess my throne. For that hath been done by Zelmane, but not, as I feared, to my ruin but to my preservation.’
   But when he had once named Zelmane, that name was as good as a pulley to make the clock of his praises run on in such sort that (Philanax found) was more exquisite than the only admiration of virtue breedeth: which his faithful heart inwardly repining at made him shrink away as soon as he could, to go about the other matters of importance which Basilius had enjoined unto him.
   Basilius returned into the lodge, thus by himself construing the oracle: that in that he said his elder care should by princely mean be stolen away from him and yet not lost, it was now performed, since Zelmane had, as it were, robbed from him the care of his first begotten child; yet was it not lost, since in his heart the ground of it remained: that his younger should with Nature’s bliss embrace the lcve of Zelmane, because he had so commanded her for his sake to do; yet should it be with as much hate of nature, for being so hateful an opposite to the jealousy he thought her mother had of him. The sitting in his seat he deemed by her already performed. But that which most comforted him was his interpretation of the adultery, which he thought he should commit with Zelmane, whom afterwards he should have to his wife. The point of his daughters’ marriage, because it threatened his death withal, he determined to prevent with keeping them, while he lived, unmarried. But having, as he thought, gotten thus much understanding of the oracle, he determined for three days after to perform certain rites to Apollo; and even then began with his wife and daughters to sing this hymn, by them yearly used:
Apollo great, whose beams the greater world do light,
And in our little world do clear our inward sight,
Which ever shine, though hid from earth by earthly shade, 
Whose lights do ever live, but in our darkness fade;
Thou god, whose youth was decked with spoil of Python's skin, 
(So humble knowledge can throw down the snakish sin)
Latona’s son, whose birth in pain and travail long 
Doth teach, to learn the good what travails do belong:
In travail of our life, a short but tedious space,
While brickie hour glass runs, guide thou our panting pace: 
Give us foresightful minds: give us minds to obey 
What foresight tells; our thoughts upon thy knowledge stay. 
Let so our fruits grow up that nature be maintain’d:
But so our hearts keep down, with vice they be not stain'd.
Let this assured hold our judgements ever take,
That nothing wins the heaven, but what doth earth forsake.
   As soon as he had ended his devotion (all the privileged shepherds being now come) knowing well enough he might lay all his care upon Philanax, he was willing to sweeten the taste of this past tumult with some rural pastimes. For which, while the shepherds prepared themselves in their best manner, Basilius took his daughter Philoclea aside, and with such haste, as if his ears hunted for words, desired to know how she had found Zelmane. She humbly answered him according to the agreement betwixt them, that thus much for her sake Zelmane was content to descend from her former resolution as to hear him whensoever he would speak; and further than that, she said, as Zelmane had not granted, so she neither did nor ever would desire. Basilius kissed her with more than fatherly thanks, and straight (like a hard-kept ward new come to his lands) would fain have used the benefit of that grant in laying his sickness before his only physician. But Zelmane (that had not yet fully determined with herself how to bear herself towards him) made him in a few words understand that the time, in respect of the company, was unfit for such a parley; and therefore to keep his brains the busier, letting him understand what she had learned of his daughters touching Erona’s distress (whom in her travel she had known and been greatly beholding to) she desired him to finish the rest for so far as Plangus had told him; because, she said (and she said truly) she was full of care for that lady whose desert, only except an over-base choice, was nothing agreeable to misfortune. Basilius, glad that she would command him anything, but more glad that in excusing the unfitness of that time she argued an intention to grant a fitter, obeyed her in this manner.
   
   CHAPTER 29
   ‘Madam,’ said he, ‘it is very true that since years enabled me to judge what is or is not to be pitied, I never saw anything that more moved me to justify a vehement compassion in myself than the estate of that prince whom, strong against all his own afflictions (which yet were great as I perceive you have heard) yet true and noble love had so pulled down as to lie under sorrow for another. Insomuch as I could not temper my long idle pen in that subject, which I perceive you have seen. But then to leave that unrepeated which I find my daughters have told you, it may please you to understand, since it pleaseth you to demand, that Antiphilus being crowned and so left by the famous princes Musi- dorus and Pyrocles (led thence by the challenge of Anaxius, who is now in these provinces of Greece, making a dishonourable enquiry after that excellent prince Pyrocles, already perished) - Antiphilus, I say, being crowned and delivered from the presence of those two, whose virtues (while they were present) like good schoolmasters suppressed his vanities, he had not strength of mind enough in him to make long delay of discovering what manner of man he was. But straight like one carried up to so high a place that he loseth the discerning of the ground over which he is, so was his mind lifted so far beyond the level of his own discourse, that remembering only that himself was in the high seat of a king, he could not perceive that he was a king of reasonable creatures who would quickly scorn follies and repine at injuries. But imagining no so true property of sovereignty as to do what he listed and to list whatsoever pleased his fancy, he quickly made his kingdom a tennis-court where his subjects should be the balls; not in truth cruelly but licentiously abusing them, presuming so far upon himself that what he did was liked of everybody, nay, that his disgraces were favours, and all because he was a king. For in nature not able to conceive the bounds of great matters, suddenly borne into an unknown ocean of absolute power, he was swayed withal, he knew not how, as every wind of passions puffed him. Whereto nothing helped him better than that poisonous sugar of flattery, which some used, out of the innate baseness of their heart, straight like dogs fawning upon the greatest: others secretly hating him and disdaining his great rising so suddenly, so undeservedly, finding his humour, bent their exalting him only to his overthrow, like the bird that carries the shell-fish high to break him the easier with his fall. But his mind, being an apt matter to receive what form their amplifying speeches would lay upon it, danced so pretty a measure to their false music that he thought himself the wisest and worthiest and best beloved that ever gave honour to a royal title. And being but obscurely born, he had found out unblushing pedigrees that made him not only of the blood royal but true heir, though unjustly dispossessed by Erona’s ancestors. And like the foolish bird that, when it so hides the head that it sees not itself, thinks nobody else sees it, so did he imagine that nobody knew his baseness, while he himself turned his eyes from it.
   ‘Then vainness, a meagre friend to gratefulness, brought him so to despise Erona as of whom he had received no benefit, that within half a year’s marriage he began to pretend barrenness; and making first an unlawful law of having more wives than one, he (stvll keeping Erona) under-hand, by messages sought Artaxia: who no less hating him than loving (as unlucky a choice) the naughty king Plexirtus, yet to bring to pass what she purposed, was content to train him into false hopes, till already his imagination had crowned him king of Armenia and had made that but the foundation of more and more monarchies, as if fortune had only gotten eyes to cherish him. In which time a great assembly of most part of all the princes of Asia being to do honour to the never sufficiently praised Pyrocles and Musidorus, he would be one; not to acknowledge his obligation (which was as great as any of the others) but looking to have been “young-mastered” among those great estates as he was among his abusing underlings. But so many valorous princes indeed far nearer to disdain him than otherwise, he was quickly (as standing upon no true ground inwardly) out of countenance with himself; till his seldom comfortless flatterers, persuading him it was envy and fear of his expected greatness, made him haste away from that company, and without further delay appointed the meeting with Artaxia, so incredibly blinded with the over-bright shining of his royalty that he could think such a queen would be content to be joint-patent with another to have such an husband. Poor Erona to all this obeyed, either vehemency of affection making her stoop to so over-base a servitude, or astonished with an unlooked for fortune, dull to any behooveful resolution, or (as many times it falls out even in great hearts when they can accuse none but themselves) desperately bent to maintain it. For so went she on in that way of her love that, poor lady, to be beyond all other examples of ill-set affection, she was brought to write to Artaxia that she was content, for the public good, to be a second wife and yield the first place to her; nay to extol him, and even woo Artaxia for him.
   'But Artaxia, mortally hating them both for her brother’s sake, was content to hide her hate till she had time to show it; and pretending that all her grudge was against the two paragons of virtue, Musidorus and Pyrocles, even met them half-way in excusing her brother’s murder, as not being principal actors, and of the other side, driven to what they did by the ever-pardonable necessity: and so well handled the matter as, though she promised nothing, yet Antiphilus promised himself all that she would have him think. And so a solemn interview was appointed. But, as the poets say, Hymen had not there his saffron-coloured coat. For Artaxia laying men secretly (and easily they might be secret, since Antiphilus thought she over-ran him in love) when he came even ready to embrace her, showing rather a countenance of accepting than offering, they came forth and, having much advantage both in number, valour and fore-preparation, put all his company to the sword but such as could fly away. As for Antiphilus, she caused him and Erona both to be put in irons, hasting back toward her brother’s tomb, upon which she meant to sacrifice them; making the love of her brother stand between her and all other motions of grace from which by nature she was alienated.
   ‘But great diversity in them two quickly discovered itself for the bearing of that affliction. For Antiphilus, who had no greatness but outward, that taken away, was ready to fall faster than calamity could thrust him; with fruitless begging of life (where reason might well assure him his death was resolved) and weak bemoaning his fortune to give his enemies a most pleasing music, with many promises and protestations to as little purpose as from a little mind. But Erona, sad indeed, yet like one rather used than new fallen to sadness (as who had the joys of her heart already broken) seemed rather to welcome than to shun that end of misery; speaking little, but what she spake was for Antiphilus, remembering his guiltlessness, being at that time prisoner to Tiri- dates when the valiant princes slew him: to the disgrace of men, showing that there are women both more wise to judge what is to be expected and more constant to bear it when it is happened.
   ‘But her wit endeared by her youth, her affliction by her birth, and her sadness by her beauty, made this noble prince Plangus, who (never almost from his cousin Artaxia) was now present at Erona’s taking, to perceive the shape of loveliness more perfectly in woe than in joyfulness (as in a picture which receives greater life by the darkness of shadows than by more glittering colours) and seeing to like, and liking to love, and loving straight to feel the most incident effects of love, to serve and preserve. So borne by the hasty tide of short leisure, he did hastily deliver together his affection and affectionate care. But she (as if he had spoken of a small matter, when he mentioned her life, to which she had not leisure to attend) desired him if he loved her, to show it in finding some way to save Antiphilus. For her, she found the world but a wearisome stage unto her, where she played a part against her will; and therefore besought him not to cast his love in so unfruitful a place as could not love itself, but for a testimony of constancy and a suitableness to his word, to do so much comfort to her mind as that for her sake Antiphilus were saved.
   ‘He told me how much he argued against her tendering him who had so ungratefully betrayed her and foolishly cast away himself. But perceiving she did not only bend her very good wits to speak for him against herself, but when such a cause could be allied to no reason, yet love would needs make itself a cause and bar her rather from hearing than yield that she should yield to such arguments, he likewise (in whom the power of love, as they say of spirits, was subject to the love in her) with grief consented, and though backwardly, was diligent to labour the help of Antiphilus, a man whom he not only hated as a traitor to Erona but envied as a possessor of Erona. Yet love sware his heart, in spite of his heart, should make him become a servant to his rival. And so did he, seeking all the means of persuading Artaxia which the authority of so near and so virtuous a kinsman could give unto him. But she, to whom the eloquence of hatred had given revenge the face of delight, rejected all such motions; but rather the more closely imprisoning them in her chief city, where she kept them with intention at the birthday of Tiridates (which was very near) to execute Antiphilus, and at the day of his death (which was about half a year after) to use the same rigour towards Erona. Plangus, much grieved because much loving, attempted the humours of the Lycians, to see whether they would come in with forces to succour their princess. But there the next inheritor to the crown (with the true play that is used in the game of kingdoms) had no sooner his mistress in captivity but he had usurped her place, and making her odious to her people because of the unfit election she had made, had so left no hope there: but, which is worse, had sent to Artaxia, persuading the justicing her, because that unjustice might give his title the name of justice.
   ‘Wanting that way, Plangus practised with some dear friends of his to save Antiphilus out of prison, whose day because it was much nearer than Erona’s and that he well found she had twisted her life upon the same thread with his, he determined first to get him out of prison; and to that end having prepared all matters as well as in such case he could, where Artaxia had set many of Tiridates’ old servants to have well marking eyes, he conferred with Antiphilus as, by the authority he had, he found means to do, and agreed with him of the time and manner how he should by the death of some of his jailors escape.
   ‘But all being well ordered, and Plangus willingly putting himself into the greatest danger, Antiphilus (who like a bladder swelled ready to break while it was full of the wind of prosperity, that being out, was so abjected as apt to be trod on by everybody) when it came to the point that with some hazard he might be in apparent likelihood to avoid the uttermost harm, his heart fainted, and, weak fool, neither hoping nor fearing as he should, gat a conceit that with betraying this practice he might obtain pardon: and therefore even a little before Plangus should have come unto him, opened the whole practice to him that had the charge, with unpitied tears idly protesting he had rather die by Artaxia’s commandment than against her will escape; yet begging life upon any the hardest and wretchedest conditions that she would lay upon him. His keeper provided accordingly, so that when Plangus came, he was like, himself, to have been entrapped, but that finding with a lucky insight that it was discovered, he retired, and calling his friends about him, stood upon his guard as he had good cause. For Artaxia (accounting him most ungrateful, considering that her brother and she had not only preserved him against the malice of his father but e/er used him much liker his birth than his fortune) sent forces to apprehend him. But he among the martial men had gotten so great love that he could not only keep himself from her malice, but work in their minds a compassion of Erona’s adversity.
   ‘But for the succour of Antiphilus he could get nobody to join with him, the contempt of him having not been able to qualify the hatred, so that Artaxia might easily upon him perform her will; which was (at the humble suit of all the women of that dty) to deliver him to their censure, who mortally hating him for having made a law of polygamy, after many tortures, forced him to throw himself from a high pyramid which was built over Tiridates’ tomb, and so to end his false-hearted life which had planted no strong thought in him but that he could be unkind.
   ‘But Plangus well perceiving that Artaxia stayed only for the appointed day that the fair Erona’s body, consumed to ashes, should make a notorious testimony how deeply her brother’s death was engraven in her breast, he assembled good numbers of friends wbom his virtue, though a stranger, had tied unto him, by force to give her liberty. Contrariwise, Artaxia, to whom anger gave more courage than her sex did fear, used her regal authority the most she could to suppress that sedition and have her will, which, she thought, is the most princely thing that may be. But Plangus (who indeed, as all men witness, is one of the best captains, both for policy and valour, that are trained in the school of Mars) in a conflict overthrew Artaxia’s power though of far greater number; and there took prisoner a base son of her brother’s whom she dearly affected, and then sent her word, that he should run the same race of fortune, whatsover it was, that Erona did; and happy was that threatening for her, for else Artaxia had hastened the day of her death in respect of those tumults.
   'But now (some principal noblemen of that country interposing themselves) it was agreed that all persons else fully pardoned, and all prisoners, exccpt Erona, delivered, she should be put into the hands of a principal nobleman who had a castle of great strength, upon oath, if by the day two years from Tiridates’ death, Pyrocles and Musidorus did not in person combat and overcome two knights, whom she appointed to maintain her quarrel against Erona and them of having by treason destroyed her brother, that then Erona should be that same day burned to ashes: but if they came, and had the victory, she should be delivered; but upon no occasion neither freed nor executed till that day. And hereto of both sides, all took solemn oath, and so the peace was concluded; they of Plangus’ party forcing him to agree, though he himself the sooner condescended, knowing the courtesy of those two excellent princes not to refuse so noble a quarrel, and their power such as two more (like the other two) were not able to resist. But Artaxia was more, and upon better ground, pleased with this action; for she had even newly received news from Plexirtus that upon the sea he had caused them both to perish, and therefore she held herself sure of the match.
   ‘But poor Plangus knew not so much, and therefore seeing his party (as most times it falls out in like case) hungry of any conditions of peace, accepted them: and then obtained leave of the lord that indifferently kept her to visit Erona, whom he found full of desperate sorrow, suffering neither his unworthiness, nor his wrongs, nor his death (which is the natural conclusion of all worldly acts) either to cover with forgetfulness or diminish with consideration the affection she had borne him; but even glorying in affliction and shunning all comfort, she seemed to have no delight but in making herself the picture of misery. So that when Plangus came to her, she fell in deadly trances, as if in him she had seen the death of Antiphilus because he had not succoured him: and yet (her virtue striving) she did at one time acknowledge herself bound and profess herself injured; instead of allowing the conclusion they had made, or writing to the princes as he wished her to do, craving nothing but some speedy death to follow her (in spite of just hate) beloved Antiphilus.
   ‘So that Plangus, having nothing but a ravished kiss from her hand at their parting, went away towards Greece whitherward he understood the princes were embarked. But by the way it was his fortune to intercept letters written by Artaxia to Plexirtus, wherein she signified her accepting him to her husband, whom she had ever favoured, so much the rather as he had performed the conditions of her marriage in bringing to their deserved end her greatest enemies: withal thanking the sea, in such terms as he might well perceive it was by some treason wrought in Plexirtus' ship. Whereupon, to make more diligent search, he took ship himself and came into Laconia enquiring and by his enquiry finding, that such a ship was indeed with fight and fire perished, none, almost, escaping. But for Pyrocles and Musidorus, it was assuredly determined that they were cast away, for the name of such princes, especially in Greece, would quickly else have been a large witness to the contrary.
   ‘Full of grief with that, for the loss of such who left the world poor of perfection, but more sorry for Erona’s sake who now by them could not be relieved, a new advertisement from Armenia overtook him which multiplied the force of his anguish. It was a message from the nobleman who had Erona in ward, giving him to understand that since his departure, Artaxia, using the benefit of time, had beseiged him in his castle, demanding present delivery of her whom yet for his faith given he would not before the day appointed, if possibly he could resist - which he foresaw long he should not do for want of victual which he had not so wisely provided, because he trusted upon the general oath taken for two years’ space: and therefore willed him to make haste to his succour, and come with no small forces, for all they that were of his side in Armenia were consumed, and Artaxia had increased her might by marriage of Plexirtus, who, now crowned king there, sticked not to glory in the murder of Pyrocles and Musidorus, as having just cause thereto in respect of the deaths of bis sister Andromana, her son, his nephew and his own daughter Zelmane, all whose loss he unjustly charged them withal, and now openly sticked not to confess what a revenge his wit had brought forth.
   ‘Plangus, much astonished herewith, bethought himself what to do, for to return to Armenia was vain since his friends there were utterly overthrown. Then thought he of going to his father; but he had already, even since the death of his stepmother and brother, attempted the recovering his favour, and all in vain. For they that had before joined with Andromana to do him the wrong thought now no life for them if he returned, and therefore kept him still, with new forged suspicions, odious to his father. So that Plangus, reserving that for a work of longer time than the saving of Erona could bear, determined to go to the mighty and good king Euarchus; who lately having, to his eternal fame, fully not only conquered his enemies but established good government in their countries, he hoped he might have present succour of him, both for the justness of the cause and revenge of his children’s death, by so heinous a treason murdered. Therefore with diligence he went to him, and by the way (passing through my country) it was my hap to find him, the most overthrown man with grief that ever I hope to see again. For still it seemed he had Erona at a stake before his eyes, such an apprehension he had taken of her danger, which in despite of all the comfort I could give him, he poured out in such lamentations that I was moved not to let him pass till he had made a full declaration, which by pieces my daughters and I have delivered unto you. Fain he would have had succour of myself, but the course of my life being otherwise bent, I only accompanied him with some that might safely guide him to the great Euarchus; for my part having had some of his speeches so feelingly in my memory that at an idle time, as I told you, I set them down dialogue-wise in such manner as you have seen. And thus, excellent lady, I have obeyed you in this story; wherein if it well please you to consider what is the strange power of love and what is due to his authority, you shall exercise therein the true nobleness of your judgement, and do the more right to the unfortunate historian.’
   Zelmane, sighing for Erona’s sake, yet inwardly comforted in that she assured herself Euarchus would not spare to take in hand the just delivering of her joined with the just revenge of his children's loss, having now what she desired of Basilius, to avoid his further discourses of affection encouraged the shepherds to begin, whom she saw already ready for them.
   THE SECOND ECLOGUES
   The rude tumult of the Enispians gave occasion to the honest shepherds to begin their Pastorals this day with a dance, which they called the skirmish betwixt Reason and Passion. For seven shepherds (which were named the reasonable shepherds) joined themselves; four of them making a square and the other two going a little wide of either side, like wings for the main battle, and the seventh man foremost, like the forlorn hope, to begin the skirmish. In like order came out the seven appassionated shepherds, all keeping the pace of their foot by their voice, and sundry consorted instruments they held in their arms. And first, the foremost of the Reasonable side began to sing:
   REASON: Thou rebel vile, come, to thy mastei' yield.
   And the other that met with him answered:
PASSION: No, tyrant, no; mine, mine shall be the field.
R: Can Reason then a tyrant counted be?
P: If Reason will that Passions be not free.
R: But Reason will that Reason govern most
P: And Passion will that Passion rule the roast
R: Your will is will, but Reason reason is.
P: Will hath his will when Reason’s will doth miss.
R: Whom Passion leads unto his death is bent.
P: And let him die, so that he die content.
R: By nature you to Reason faith have sworn.
P: Not so, but fellow-like together born.
R: Who Passion doth ensue lives in annoy.
P: Who Passion doth forsake lives void of joy.
R: Passion is blind, and treads an unknown trace.
P: Reason hath eyes to see his own ill case.

Then as they approached nearer, the two of Reason’s side, as if they shot at the other, thus sang:

R: Dare Passions then abide in Reason's light?
P: And is not Reason dimmed with Passion’s might?
R: O foolish thing, which glory doth destroy!
P: O glorious title of a foolish toy!
R: Weakness you are, dare you with our strength fight?
P: Because our weakness weakeneth all your might.
R: O sacred Reason, help our virtuous toils.
P: O Passion, pass on feeble Reason's spoils.
R: We with ourselves abide a daily strife.
P: We gladly use the sweetness of our life.
R: But yet our strife sure peace in end doth breed.
P: We now have peace, your peace we do not need.
Then did the two square battles meet, and instead of fighting, embrace one another, singing thus:
R: We are too strong: but Reason seeks not blood.
P: Who be too weak do feign they be too good.
R: Though we cannot o’ercome, our cause is just.
P: Let us o’ercome, and let us be unjust
R: Yet Passion, yield at length to Reason’s stroke.
P: What shall we win by taking Reason’s yoke?
R: The joys you have shall be made permanent P: But so we shall with grief learn to repent.
R: Repent indeed, but that shall be your bliss.
P: How know we that, since present joys we miss?
R: You know it not; of Reason therefore know it
P: No Reason yet had ever skill to show it
R, P: Then let us both to heavenly rules give place,
   Which Passions kill, and Reason do deface.
   Then embraced they one another and came to the king, who framed his praises of them according to Zelmane’s liking; whose unrestrained parts, the mind and eye, had their free course to the delicate Philoclea, whose look was not short in well requiting it although she knew it was a hateful sight to her jealous mother. But Dicus (that had in this time taken a great liking of Dorus for the good parts he found above his age in him) had a delight to taste the fruits of his wit, though in a subject which he himself most of all other despised; and so entered to speech with him in the manner of this following eclogue:
   DICUS • DORUS
DICUS: Dorus, tell me, where is thy wonted motion,
To make those woods resound thy lamentation?
Thy saint is dead, or dead is thy devotion.
For who doth hold his love in estimation,
To witness that he thinks his thoughts delicious,
Seeks to make each thing badge of his sweet passion.

DORUS: But what doth make thee, Dicus, so suspicious 
Of my due faith, which needs must be immutable?
Who others’ virtue doubt, themselves are vicious.
Not so; although my metal were most mutable,
Her beams have wrought therein most sure impression.
To such a force soon change were nothing suitable.

DICUS: The heart well set doth never shun confession:
If noble be thy bands, make them notorious:
Silence doth seem the mask of base oppression:
Who glories in his love doth make love glorious.
But who doth fear, or bideth mute wilfully,
Shows guilty heart doth deem his state opprobrious.
Thou then, that fram’st both words and voice most skilfully, 
Yield to our ears a sweet and sound relation 
If love took thee by force, or caught thee guilefully.

DORUS: If sunny beams shame heavenly habitation,
If three-leav'd grass seem to the sheep unsavoury,
Then base and sour is love’s most high vocation.
Or if sheep’s cries can help the sun’s own bravery,
Then may I hope, my pipe may have ability 
To help her praise, who decks me in her slavery.
No, no; no words ennoble self-nobility.
As for your doubts, her voice was it deceived me,
Her eyes the force beyond my possibility.

DICUS: Thy words well voic’d, well grac’d, had almost heaved me 
Quite from myself, to love love’s contemplation;
Till of these thoughts thy sudden end bereaved me.
Go on therefore, and tell us by what fashion,
In thy own proof he gets so strange possession,
And how, possessed, he strengthens his invasion.

DORUS: Sight is his root, in thought is his progression,
His childhood wonder, prenticeship attention,
His youth delight, his age the soul's oppression:
Doubt is his sleep, he waketh in invention;
Fancy his food, his clothing is of carefulness;
Beauty his book, his play lovers’ dissension:
His eyes are curious search, but veiled with warefulness;
His wings desire, oft clipped with desperation.
Largess, his hands, could never skill of sparefulness. 
But how he doth by might, or by persuasion 
To conquer, and his conquest how to ratify,
Experience doubts, and schools hold disputation.

DICUS: But so thy sheep may thy good wishes satisfy 
With large increase, and wool of fine perfection,
So she thy love, her eyes thy eyes may gratify 
As thou wilt give our souls a dear refection,
By telling how she was, how now she framed is 
To help, or hurt in thee her own infection.

DORUS: Blest be the name wherewith my mistress named is: 
Whose wounds are salves, whose yokes please more than pleasure doth:
Her stains are beams: virtue the fault she blamed is,
The heart, eye, ear, here only find his treasure doth.
All numbering arts her endless graces number not:
Time, place, life, wit, scarcely her rare gifts measure doth.
Is she in rage? So is the sun in summer hot,
Yet harvest brings. Doth she, alas, absent herself?
The sun is hid; his kindly shadows cumber not.
But when to give some grace she doth content herself,
O then it shines; then are the heavens distributed,
And Venus seems, to make up her, she spent herself. 
Thus then, I say, my mischiefs have contributed
A greater good by her divine reflection;
My harms to me, my bliss to her attributed.
Thus she is framed: her eyes are my direction,
Her love my life, her anger my instruction:
Lastly, what so she is, that's my protection.

DICUS: Thy safety sure is wrapped in destruction,
For that construction thine own words do bear.
A man to fear a woman’s moody eye,
Makes reason lie a slave to servile sense,
A weak defence where weakness is thy force:
So is remorse in folly dearly bought.

DORUS: If I had thought to hear blasphemous words,
My breast to swords, my soul to hell have sold
I rather would, than thus mine ears defile 
With words so vile, which viler breath doth breed.
O herds take heed; for I a wolf have found,
Who hunting round the strongest for to kill,
His breast doth fill with earth of others’ woe,
And loaden so pulls down, pull’d down destroys.
O shepherds’ boys, eschew those tongues of venom 
Which do envenom both the soul and senses;
Our best defences are to fly these adders.
O tongues like ladders made to climb dishonour,
Who judge that honour which hath scope to slander!

DICUS: Dorus you wander far in great reproaches;
So love encroaches on your charmed reason,
But it is season for to end our singing,
Such anger bringing: as for me, my fancy 
In sick-man’s frenzy rather takes compassion 
Than rage for rage: rather my wish I send to thee 
Thou soon may have some help, or change of passion:
She oft her looks, the stars her favour bend to thee:
Fortune store, nature health, love grant persuasion.
A quiet mind none but thyself can lend to thee,
Thus I commend to thee all our former love.

DORUS: Well do I prove, error lies oft in zeal,
Yet it is seal, though error, of true heart.
Nought could impart such heats to friendly mind,
But for to find thy words did her disgrace,
Whose only face the little heaven is:
Which who doth miss, his eyes are but delusions,
Barred from their chiefest object of delightfulness,
Thrown on this earth, the chaos of confusions.
As for thy wish to my enraged spitefulness,
The lovely blow with rare reward, my prayer is 
Thou may’st love her, that I may see thy sightfulness.
The quiet mind (whereof myself impairer is,
As thou dost think) should most of all disquiet me 
Without her love, than any mind who fairer is.
Her only cure from surfeit-woes can diet me:
She holds the balance of my contentation:
Her cleared eyes, nought else, in storms can quiet me.
Nay rather than my ease discontentation 
Should breed to her, let me for aye dejected be 
From any joy, which might her grief occasion.
With so sweet plagues my happy harms infected be:
Pain wills me die, yet will of death I mortify:
For though life irks, in life my loves protected be.
Thus for each change my changeless heart I fortify.
   When they had ended, to the good pleasing of the assistants, especially of Zelmane, who never forgat to give due commendations to her friend Dorus, Basilius called Lamon to end his discourse of Strephon and Claius, wherewith the other day he marked Zelmane to have been exceedingly delighted. But him sickness had stayed from that assembly; which gave occasion to Histor and Damon, two young shepherds, taking upon them the two friendly rivals’ names, to present Basilius with some other of their complaints ecloguowise, and first with this double Sestine.
   STREPHON • CLAIUS
STREPHON: Ye goat-herd gods, that love the grassy mountains, 
Ye nymphs that haunt the springs in pleasant valleys,
Ye satyrs joy’d with free and quiet forests,
Vouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music,
Which to my woes gives still an early morning,
And draws the dolour on till weary evening.

CLAIUS: O Mercury, foregoer to the evening,
O heavenly huntress of the savage mountains,
O lovely star, entitled of the morning,
While that my voice doth fill these woeful valleys,
Vouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music 
Which oft hath Echo tired in secret forests.

STREPHON: I that was once free-burgess of the forests,
Where shade from sun, and sport I sought at evening,
I that was once esteem’d for pleasant music,
Am banish’d now among the monstrous mountains 
Of huge despair, and foul affliction’s valleys,
Am grown a screech-owl to myself each morning.

CLAIUS: I that was once delighted every morning,
Hunting the wild inhabiters of forests:
I that was once the music of these valleys 
So darken’d am, that all my day is evening;
Heart-broken so, that molehills seem high mountains,
And fill the vales with cries instead of music.

STREPHON: Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music 
Hath made itself a crier of the morning:
And hath with wailing strength climb’d highest mountains. 
Long since my thoughts more desert be than forests:
Long since I see my joys come to their evening,
And state thrown down to over-trodden valleys.

CLAIUS: Long since the happy dwellers of these valleys 
Have pray’d me leave my strange exclaiming music,
Which troubles their day’s work, and joys of evening:
Long since I hate the night, more hate the morning:
Long since my thoughts chase me like beasts in forests,
And make me wish myself laid under mountains.

STREPHON: Me seems I see the high and stately mountains 
Transform themselves to low dejected valleys:
Me seems I hear in these ill-changed forests,
The Nightingales do learn of Owls their music 
Me seems I feel the comfort of the morning,
Turn’d to the mortal serene of an evening.

CLAIUS: Me seems I see a filthy cloudy evening,
As soon as sun begins to climb the mountains:
Me seems I feel a noisome scent, the morning 
When I do smell the flowers of these valleys:
Me seems I hear, when I do hear sweet music,
The dreadful cries of murder’d men in forests.

STREPHON: I wish to fire the trees of all these forests;
I give the sun a last farewell each evening;
I curse the fiddling finders out of music:
With envy I do hate the lofty mountains;
And with despite despise the humble valleys:
I do detest night, evening, day and morning.

CLAIUS: Curse to myself my prayer is, the morning;
My fire is more than can be made with forests;
My state more base than are the basest valleys:
I wish no evenings more to see, each evening;
Shamed I hate myself in sight of mountains,
And stop mine ears lest I grow mad with music.

STREPHON: For she whose parts maintain’d a perfect music, 
Whose beauty shin’d more than the blushing morning,
Who much did pass in state the stately mountains,
In straightness pass’d the cedars of the forests,
Hath cast me, wretch, into eternal evening,
By taking her two suns from these dark valleys.

CLAIUS: For she, with whom compar’d, the alps are valleys,
She, whose least word brings from the spheres their music,
At whose approach the sun rose in the evening,
Who, where she went, bare in her forehead morning,
Is gone, is gone, from those our spoiled forests,
Turning to deserts our best pastur’d mountains.

STREPHON: These mountains witness shall, so shall these valleys,
These forests eke, made wretched by our music.

CLAIUS: Our morning hymn is this, and song at evening.

But as though all this had been but the taking of a taste of their wailings, Strephon again began this Dizain which was answered unto him in that kind of verse which is called the crown.

STREPHON • CLAIUS

STREPHON: I joy in grief, and do detest all joys;
Despise delight, am tir’d with thought of ease:
I turn my mind to all forms of annoys.
And with the change of them my fancy please.
I study that which may me most displease,
And in despite of that displeasure’s might,
Embrace that most, that most my soul destroys;
Blinded with beams, fell darkness is my sight;
Dwell in my ruins, feed with sucking smart;
I think from me, not from my woes to part.

CLAIUS: I think from me, not from my woes to part,
And loath this time call'd life, nay think that life 
Nature to me for torment did impart;
Think my hard haps have blunted death’s sharp knife,
Not sparing me, in whom his works be rife:
And thinking this, think Nature, Life and Death 
Place Sorrow’s triumph on my conquered heart,
Whereto I yield, and seek none other breath 
But from the scent of some infectious grave:
Nor of my fortune aught but mischief crave.

STREPHONE: Nor of my fortune aught but mischief crave, 
And seek to nourish that, which now contains 
All what I am: if I myself will save,
Then must I save what in me chiefly reigns,
Which is the hateful web of Sorrow’s pains.
Sorrow then cherish me, for I am Sorrow:
No being now but Sorrow I can have:
Then deck me as thine own; thy help I borrow,
Since thou my riches art, and that thou hast 
Enough to make a fertile mind lie waste.

CLAIUS: Enough to make a fertile mind lie waste 
Is that huge storm, which pours itself on me:
Hailstones of tears, of sighs a monstrous blast,
Thunders of cries; lightning my wild looks be,
The darkened heav’n my-soul, which nought can see;
The flying sprites which trees by roots uptear 
Be those despairs which have my hopes quite rased.
The difference is: all folks those storms forbear,
But I cannot; who then myself should fly,
So close unto myself my wracks do lie.

STREPHON: So dose unto myself my wracks do lie, 
Both cause, effect, beginning, and the end 
Are all in me: what help then can I try?
My ship, myself, whose course to Love doth bend, 
Sore beaten doth her mast of Comfort spend:
Her cable, Reason, breaks from anchor Hope:
Fancy, her tackling, tom away doth fly:
Ruin, the wind, hath blown her from her scope: 
Bruised with waves of Cares, but broken is 
On rock Despair, the burial of my Bliss.

CLAIUS: On rock Despair, the burial of my Bliss,
I long do plough with plough of deep Desire:
The seed Fast-meaning is, no truth to miss:
I harrow it with Thoughts, which all conspire 
Favour to make my chief and only hire.
But woe is me, the year is gone about,
And now I fain would reap, I reap but this,
Hate fully grown, Absence new sprungen out.
So that I see, although my sight impair,
Vain is their pain, who labour in Despair.

STREPHON: Vain is their pain, who labour in Despair. 
For so did I, when with my angle, Will,
I sought to catch the fish Torpedo fair.
Ev’n then Despair did Hope already kill:
Yet Fancy would perforce employ his skill,
And this hath got; the catcher now is caught 
Lam'd with the angle, which itself did bear,
And unto Death, quite drown’d in Dolors, brought 
To Death, as then disguis’d in her fair face:
Thus, thus, alas, I had my loss in chase.

CLAIUS: Thus, thus', alas, I had my loss in chase, 
When first that crowned Basilisk I knew, 
Whose footsteps I with kisses oft did trace,
Till by such hap, as I must ever rue,
Mine eyes did light upon her shining hue,
And hers on me, astonish’d with that sight.
Since then my heart did lose his wonted place,
Infected so with her sweet poison’s might,
That, leaving me for dead, to her it went:
But ah, her flight hath my dead reliques spent.

STREPHON: But ah, her flight hath my dead reliques spent,
Her flight, from me, from me, though dead to me,
Yet living still in her, while her beams lent 
Such vital spark, that her mine eyes might see.
But now those living lights absented be,
Full dead before, I now to dust should fall,
But that eternal pains my soul have hent,
And keep it still within this body thrall,
That thus I must, while in this death I dwell,
In earthly fetters feel a lasting hell.


CLAIUS: In earthly fetters feel a lasting hell 
Alas, I do; from which to find release,
I would the earth, I would the heavens sell.
But vain it is to think those pains should cease,
"Where life is death, and death cannot breed peace.
O fair, O only fair, from thee alas,
Those foul, most foul disasters to me fell;
Since thou from me (O me) O sun did'st pass.
Therefore esteeming all good blessings toys,
I joy in grief, and do detest all joys.

STREPHON: I joy in grief, and do detest all joys,
But now an end, O Claius, now an end,
For even the herbs our hateful music stroys,
And from our burning breath the trees do bend.
   So well were these wailful complaints accorded to the passions of all the princely hearers, while every one made what he heard of another the balance of his own fortune, that they stood a long while stricken in sad and silent consideration of them. Which the old Geron no more marking than condemning in them, desirous to set forth what counsels the wisdom of age had laid up in store against such fancies, (as be thought) follies of youth, yet so as it might not appear that his words respected them, bending himself to a young shepherd named Philisides (who neither had danced nor sung with them, and had all this time lain upon the ground at the foot of a cypress tree, leaning upon his elbow with so deep a melancholy that his senses carried to his mind no delight from any of their objects) he strake him upon the shoulder with a right old man’s grace that will seem livelier than his age will afford him. And thus began unto him this eclogue.
GERON • PHILISIDES

GERON: Up, up, Philisides, let sorrows go,
Who yields to woe, doth but increase his smart 
Do not thy heart to plaintful custom bring,
But let us sing; sweet tunes do passions ease;
An old man hear who would thy fancies raise.

PHILISIDES: Who minds to please the mind drown’d in annoys 
With outward joys, which inly cannot sink,
As well may think with oil to cool the fire;
Or with desire to make such foe a friend,
Who doth his soul to endless malice bend.

GERON: Yet sure an end to each thing time doth give;
Though woes now live, at length thy woes must die.
Then virtue try, if she can work in thee 
That which we see in many time hath wrought,
And weakest hearts to constant temper brought.

PHILISIDES: WTio ever taught a skilless man to teach,
Or stop a breach that never cannon saw?
Sweet virtue’s law bars not a causeful moan.
Time shall in one my life and sorrows end,
And me perchance your constant temper lend.

GERON: What can amend where physick is refus’d?
The wits abused with will no counsel take.
Yet for my sake discover us thy grief.
Oft comes relief when most we seem in trap.
The stars thy state, fortune may change thy hap.

PHILISIDES: If fortune’s lap became my dwelling place, 
And all the stars conspired to my good,
Still were I one, this still should be my case,
Ruin’s relique, care’s web, and sorrow’s food;
Since she, fair fierce, to such a state me calls,
Whose wit the stars, whose fortune fortune thralls.

GERON: Alas what falls are fall’n unto thy mind,
That there where thou confessed thy mischief lies,
Thy wit dost use still still more harms to find.
Whom wit makes vain, or blinded with his eyes,
What counsel can prevail, or light give light,
Since all his force against himself he tries?
Then each conceit that enters in his sight 
Is made, forsooth, a j urate of his woes,
Earth, sea, air, fire, heaven, hell, and ghastly spright 
Then cries to senseless things, which neither knows 
What aileth thee, and if they knew thy mind,
Would scorn in man, their king, such feeble shows.
Rebel, rebel; in golden fetters bind
This tyrant love; or rather do suppress
Those rebel-thoughts, which are thy slaves by kind.
Let not a glittering name thy fancy dress
In painted clothes; because they call it love:
There is no hate that can thee more oppress.
Begin (and half the work is done) to prove 
By rising up, upon thyself to stand,
And think she is a she, that doth thee move.
He water ploughs, and soweth in the sand,
And hopes the flickering wind with net to hold,
Who hath his hopes laid up in woman’s hand.
What man is he that hath his freedom sold?
Is he a manlike man that doth not know man 
Hath power that sex with bridle to withhold?
A fickle sex, and true in trust to no man,
A servant sex, soon proud if they be coy’d:
And to conclude, thy mistress is a woman.

PHILISIDES: O gods, how long this old fool hath annoy’d 
My wearied ears! O gods, yet grant me this,
That soon the world of his false tongue be void.
O noble age who place their only bliss 
In being heard until the hearer die,
Uttering a serpent’s mind with serpent’s hiss.
Then who will hear a well-authorized lie 
(And patience hath) let him go leam of him 
What swarms of virtues did in his youth fly;
Such hearts of brass, wise heads, and garments trim 
Were in his days: which heard, one nothing hears,
If from his words the falsehood he do skim.
And herein most their folly vain appears,
That since they still allege, ‘When they were young,’
It shows they fetch their wit from youthful years.
Like beast for sacrifice, where save the tongue 
And belly, nought is left, such sure is he,
This live-dead man in this old dungeon flung.
Old houses are thrown down for new we see:
The oldest rams are culled from the flock:
No man doth wish his horse should aged be;
The ancient oak well makes a fired block:
Old men themselves do love young wives to choose: 
Only fond youth admires a rotten stock.
Who once a white long beard well handle does 
(As his beard him, not he his beard did bare)
Though cradle-witted, must not honour lose.
O when will men leave off to judge by hair,
And think them old that have the oldest mind, 
With virtue fraught, and full of holy fearl

GERON: If that thy face were hid, or I were blind,
I yet should know a young man speaketh now, 
Such wandering reasons in thy speech I find.
He is a beast, that beast’s use will allow
For proof of man who, sprung of heav’nly fire,
Hath strongest soul when most his reins do bow. 
But fondlings fond know not your own desire,
Loth to die young, and when you must be old, 
Fondly blame that to which yourselves aspire.
But this light choler that doth make you bold, 
Rather to wrong than »uito just defence,
Is past with me, my blood is waxen cold.
Thy words, though full of malapert offence,
I weigh them not, but still will thee advise 
How thou from foolish love mayest purge thy sense. 
First think they err, that think them gaily wise 
Who well can set a passion out to show:
Such sight have they that see with goggling eyes. 
Passion bears high when puffing wit doth blow,
But is indeed a toy; if not a toy,
True cause of evils, and cause of causeless woe.
If once thou mayest that fancy gloss destroy 
'Within thyself, thou soon wilt be ashamed 
To be a player of thine own annoy.
Then let thy mind with better books be tamed;
Seek to espy her faults as well as praise,
And let thine eyes to other sports be framed.
In hunting fearful beasts, do spend some days,
Or catch the birds with pit-falls or with lime,
Or train the fox that trains so crafty lays.
Lie but to sleep, and in the early prime
Seek skill of herbs in hills, haunt brooks near night,
And try with bait how fish will bite sometime.
Go graft again, and seek to graft them right,
Those pleasant plants, those sweet and fruitful trees,
Which both the palate and the eyes delight.
Cherish the hives of wisely painful bees;
Let special care upon thy flock be stayed;
Such active mind but seldom passion sees.

PHILISIDES: Hath any man heard what this old man said?
Truly not I, who did my thoughts engage 
Where all my pains one look of her hath paid.

       Geron was even out of countenance, finding the words he thought were so wise win so little reputation at this young man’s hands; and therefore sometimes looking upon an old acquaintance of his called Mastix (one of the repiningest fellows in the world, and that beheld nobody but with a mind of mislike) saying still the world was amiss but how it should be amended he knew not, sometimes casting his eyes to the ground, even ashamed to see his grey hairs despised; at last he spied his two dogs whereof the elder was called Melampus and the younger Lelaps (indeed the jewels he ever had with him) one brawling with another; which occasion he took to restore himself to his countenance, and rating Melampus, he began to speak to his dogs as if in them a man should find more obedience than in unbridled young men.

GERON • MASTIX

GERON: Down, down, Melampus; what? Your fellow bite?
I set you o’er the flock I dearly love,
Them to defend, not with yourselves to fight.
Do you not think this will the wolves remove 
From former fear they had of your good minds,
When they shall such divided weakness prove?
What if Lelaps a better morsel finds
Than thou erst knew? Rather take part with him
Than jarL Lo, lo, even these how envy blinds.
And thou, Lelaps, let not pride make thee brim
Because thou hast thy fellow overgone,
But thank the cause; thou seest where he is dim.
Here Lelaps, here; indeed, against the foen
Of my good sheep thou never truce-time took:
Be as thou art, but be with mine at one.
For though Melampus like a wolf do look 
(For age doth make him of a wolfish hue)
Yet have I seen, when well a wolf he shook.
Fool that I am, that with my dogs speak Grew.
Come near good Mastix, ’tis now full tway score 
Of years, alas, since I good Mastix knew.
Thou heard’st even now a young man sneb me sore,
Because I red him as I would my son.
Youth will have will; age must to age therefore.

MASTIX: What marvel if in youth such fault be done,
Since that we see our saddest shepherds out,
Who have their lesson so long time begun?
Quickly secure, and easily in doubt,
Either asleep be all, if nought assail,
Or all abroad if but a cub start out.
We shepherds are like them that under sail 
Do speak high words, when all the coast is clear,
Yet to a passenger will bonnet vaiL
'I con thee thank' to whom thy dogs be dear, 
But commonly like curs we them entreat,
Save when great need of them perforce appear;
Then him we kiss, whom late before we beat 
With such intemperance, that each way grows 
Hate of the first, contempt of later feat.
And such discord 'twixt greatest shepherds flows,
That sport it is to see with how great art,
By justice' work they their own faults disclose:
Like busy boys, to win their tutor’s heart,
One saith, ‘he mocks’; another saith, ‘he plays',
The third his lesson missed, till all do smart.
As for the rest, how shepherds spend their days,
At blow-point, hot-cockles, or else at keels,
While, ‘Let us pass our time,' each shepherd says.
So small account of time the shepherd feels,
And doth not feel that life is nought but time,
And when that time is past, death holds his heels.
To age thus do they draw their youthful prime,
Knowing no more than what poor trial shows,
As fish sure trial hath of muddy slime.
This pattern good unto our children goes,
For what they see their parents love or hate 
Their first-caught sense prefers to teachers’ blows.
Those cocklings cockered we bewail too late,
When that we see our offspring gaily bent.
Women man-wood, and men effeminate.

GERON: Fie man, fie man: what words hath thy tongue lent?
Yet thou art mickle worse then ere was I;
Thy too much zeal, I fear thy brain hath spent 
We oft are angrier with the feeble fly 
For business, where it pertains him not,
Than with the poisonous toads that quiet lie.
I pray thee what hath e’er the Parrot got 
And yet they say he talks in great men’s bowers?
A cage, gilded perchance, is all his lot 
Who of his tongue the liquor gladly pours,
A good fool called with pain perhaps may be,
But even for that shall suffer mighty lours.
Let swan’s example sicker serve for thee,
Who once all birds in sweetly singing passed,
But now to silence turned his minstrelsy.
For he would sing, that others were defaced:
The Peacock’s pride, the Pie’s piled flattery,
Cormorant’s glut, Kite’s spoil, Kingfisher’s waste,
The Falcon’s fierceness, Sparrow’s lechery,
The Cuckoo's shame, the Goose’s good intent,
Even Turtle touched he with hypocrisy,
And worse of other more; till by assent
Of all the birds, but namely those were grieved,
Of fowls there called was a Parliament.
There was the Swan of dignity deprived,
And statute made he never should have voice,
Since when, I think, he hath in silence lived.
I warn thee therefore (since thou may’st have choice)
Let not thy tongue become a fiery match;
No sword so bites as that evil tool annoys.
Let our unpartial eyes a little watch
Our own demean, and soon we wonder shall
That, hunting faults, ourselves we did not catch.
Into our minds let us a little fall,
And we shall find more spots than Leopard’s skin.
Then who makes us such Judges over all?
But farewell now, thy fault is no great sin,
Come, come my curs, 'tis late, I will go in.
   And away with his dogs straight he went, as if he would be sure to have the last word; all the assembly laughing at the lustiness of the old fellow, who departed muttering to himself he had seen more in his days than twenty of them. But Basilius, who never before had heard Philisides, though having seldom failed to be at these meetings, desired him he would begin some eclogue with some other of the shepherds, according to the accustomed guise. Philisides, though very unwilling, at the king's commandment offered to sing with Thyrsis. But he directly refused him, seeing he should within few days be married to the fair Kala; and since he had gotten his desire, he would sing no more. Then the king willed Philisides to declare the discourse of his own fortunes, unknown to them, as being a stranger in that country; but he prayed the king to pardon him, the time being far too joyful to suffer the rehearsal of his miseries. But to satisfy Basilius some way, he began an eclogue betwixt himself and the Echo, framing his voice so in those desert places, as what words he would have the Echo reply unto, those he would sing higher than the rest; and so kindly framed a disputation betwixt himself and it, which with these Hexameters in the following order he uttered.

   Philisides was commended for the placing of his echo; but little did he regard their praises, who had set the foundation of his honour there where he was most despised: and therefore returning again to the train of his desolate pensiveness, Zelmane seeing nobody offer to fill the stage, as if her long restrained conceits did now burst out of prison, she thus (desiring her voice should be accorded to nothing but to Philoclea’s ears) threw down the burden of her mind in Anacreon’s kind of verses.
My muse, what ails this ardour,
To blaze my only secrets?
Alas, it is no glory
To sing my own decayed state;
Alas, it is no comfort 
To speak without an answer;
Alas, it is no wisdom
To show the wound without cure.

My muse, what ails this ardour?
Mine eyes be dim, my limbs shake,
My voice is hoarse, my throat scorched,
My tongue to this my roof cleaves.
My fancy amazed, my thoughts dulled,
My heart doth ache, my life faints,
My soul begins to take leave;
So great a passion all feel 
To think a sore so deadly
I should so rashly rip up.

My muse, what ails this ardour?
If that to sing thou art bent,
Go sing the fall of old Thebes,
The wars of ugly Centaurs,
The life, the death of Hector:
So may thy song be famous:
Or of to love thou art bent,
Recount the rape of Europe,
Adonis’ end, Venus’ net,
The sleepy kiss the moon stale: 
So may thy song be pleasant.

My muse, what ails this ardour,
To blaze my only secrets?
Wherein do only flourish 
The sorry fruits of anguish:
The song thereof a last will,
The tunes be cries, the words plaints,
The singer is the song’s theme,
Wherein no ear can have joy,
Nor eye receive due object,
Ne pleasure here, ne fame get.

My muse, what ails this ardour?
'Alas,’ she saith, ‘I am thine;
So are thy pains my pains too.
Thy heated heart my seat is,
Wherein I burn: thy breath is 
My voice, too hot to keep in.
Besides, lo here the author
Of all thy harms: lo here she,
That only can redress thee:
Of her I will demand help.

My muse, I yield: my muse, sing;
But all thy song herein knit.
The life we lead is all love;
The love we hold is all death;
Nor aught I crave to feed life,
Nor aught I seek to shun death,
But only that my goddess 
My life, my death, do count hers.

       Basilius, when she had fully ended her song, fell prostrate upon the ground and thanked the gods they had preserved his life so long as to hear the very music they themselves used in an earthly body. And then with like grace to Zelmane never left entreating her till she had (taking a lyre Basilius held for her) sung these Phaleuciacks:
       
Reason, tell me thy mind, if here be reason 
In this strange violence, to make resistance,
Where sweet graces erect the stately banner 
Of virtue’s regiment, shining in harness 
Of fortune’s diadems, by beauty mustered:
Say then reason, I say, what is thy counsel?

Her loose hairs be the shot; the breasts the pikes be;
Scouts each motion is; the hands be horsemen;
Her lips are the riches the wars to maintain,
Where well couched abides a coffer of pearl;
Her legs carriage is of all the sweet camp:
Say then reason, I say, what is thy counsel?

Her cannons be her eyes; mine eyes the walls be,
Which at first volley gave too open entry,
Nor rampier did abide; my brain was up blown,
Undermin’d with a speech, the piercer of thoughts.
Thus weakened by myself, no help remaineth;
Say then reason, I say, what is thy counsel?

And now fame, the herald of her true honour,
Doth proclaim with a sound made all by men's mouths,
That nature, sovereign of earthly dwellers,
Commands all creatures to yield obeisance 
Under this, this her own, her only darling.
Say then reason, I say, what is thy counsel?

Reason sighs, but in end he thus doth answer:
'Nought can reason avail in heavenly matters/
Thus, nature’s diamond, receive thy conquest;
Thus, pure pearl, I do yield my senses and soul,
Thus, sweet pain, I do yield what ere I can yield.
Reason look to thyself, I serve a goddess.
   Dorus had long, he thought, kept silence from saying somewhat which might tend to the glory of her in whom all glory (to his seeming) was included; but now he brake it, singing these verses called Asclepiadiks.
O sweet woods the delight of solitariness! 
O how much I do like your solitariness!
Where man’s mind hath a freed consideration 
Of goodness to receive lovely direction:
Where senses do behold th’ order of heav’nly host,
And wise thoughts do behold what the creator is: 
Contemplation here holdeth his only seat:
Bounded with no limits, borne with a wing of hope,
Climbs even unto the stars; nature is under it 
Nought disturbs thy quiet, all to thy service yields;
Each sight draws on a thought, thought mother of science; 
Sweet birds kindly do grant harmony unto thee;
Fair trees’ shade is enough fortification,
Nor dangers to thyself, if be not in thyself.

O sweet woods the delight of solitariness! 
O how much do I like your solitariness! 
Here nor treason is hid, veiled in innocence,
Nor envy’s snaky eye finds any harbour here,
Nor flatterers’ venomous insinuations,
Nor cunning humourists’ puddled opinions,
Nor courteous ruin of proffered usury,
Nor time prattled away, cradle of ignorance,
Nor causeless duty, nor cumber of arrogance,
Nor trifling title of vanity dazzleth us,
Nor golden manacles stand for a paradise.
Here wrong’s name is unheard; slander a monster is.
Keep thy spirit from abuse, here no abuse doth haunt 
What man grafts in a tree dissimulation?

O sweet woods the delight of solitariness!
O how well I do like your solitariness!
Yet dear soil, if a soul clos’d in a mansion 
As sweet as violets, fair as a lily is,
Straight as a cedar, a voice stains the canary birds’,
Whose shade safety doth hold, danger avoideth her,
Such wisdom, that in her lives Speculation,
Such goodness, that in her Simplicity triumphs,
Where envy’s snaky eye winketh or else dieth,
Slander wants a pretext, flattery gone beyond -
Oh! if such a one have bent to a lonely life
Her steps, glad we receive, glad we receive her eyes.
And think not she doth hurt our solitariness,
For such company decks such solitariness.
   The other shepherds were offering themselves to have continued the sports, but the night had so quietly spent the most part of herself among them that the king for that time licensed them. And so bringing Zelmane to her lodging, who would much rather have done the same for Phi'oclea, of all sides they went to counterfeit a sleep in their bed, for a true one their agonies could not afford them. Yet there they lay (so might they be most solitary for the food of their thoughts) till it was near noon the next day, after which Basilius was to continue his Apollo devotions, and the other to meditate upon their private desires.
   THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK
   
   The Third Book of the Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia
   CHAPTER 1
This last day’s danger, having made Pamela’s love discern what a loss it should have suffered if Dorus had been destroyed, bred such tenderness of kindness in her toward him that she could no longer keep love from looking out through her eyes and going forth in her words, whom before as a clcse prisoner she had to her heart only committed; so as finding not only by his speeches and letters, but by the pitiful oration of a languishing behaviour and the easily deciphered character of a sorrowful face, that despair began now to threaten him destruction, she grew content both to pity him and let him see she pitied him, as well by making her own beautiful beams to thaw away the former iciness of her behaviour, as by entertaining his discourses (whensoever he- did use them) in the third person of Musidorus: to so far a degree, that in the end she said that if she had been the princess whom that disguised prince had virtuously loved, she would have requited his faith with faithful affection; finding in her heart that nothing could so heartily love as virtue, with many more words to the same sense of noble favour and chaste plainness.
   Which when at the first it made that unexpected bliss shine upon Dorus, he was (like one frozen with extremity of cold over- hastily brought to a great fire) rather oppressed than relieved with such a lightning of felicity. But after the strength of nature had made him able to feel the sweetness of joyfulness, that again, being a child of passion and never acquainted with mediocrity, could not set bounds upon his happiness, nor be content to give desire a kingdom but that it must be an unlimited monarchy. So that the ground he stood upon being over-high in happiness and slippery through affection, he could not hold himself from falling into such an error which with sighs blew all comfort out of his breast and washed away all cheerfulness of his cheer with tears. For this favour filling him with hope, hope encouraging his desire, and desire considering nothing but opportunity; one time (Mopsa being called away by her mother, and he left alone with Pamela) the sudden occasion called Love, and that never stayed to ask reason’s leave but made the too much loving Dorus take her in his arms, offering to kiss her, and, as it were, to establish a trophy of his victory.
   But she, (as if she had been ready to drink a wine of excellent taste and colour which suddenly she perceived had poison in it, so did she put him away from her) looking first up to heaven, as amazed to find herself so beguiled in him; then laying the cruel punishment upon him of angry love and louring beauty, showing disdain, and a despising disdain: ‘Away,’ said she, ‘unworthy man to love or to be loved! Assure thyself, I hate myself for being so deceived: judge then what I do thee for deceiving me. Let me see thee no more, the only fall of my judgement and stain of my conscience.’
   With that she called Mopsa, not staying for any answer (which was no other but a flood of tears) which she seemed not to mark (much less to pity) and chid her for having so left her alone.
   It was not an amazement, it was not sorrow, but it was even a death which then laid hold of Dorus: which certainly at that instant would have killed him but that the fear to tarry longer in her presence (contrary to her commandment) gave him life to carry himself away from her sight and to run into the woods, where, throwing himself down at the foot of a tree, he did not fall to lamentation (for that proceeded of pitying) or grieving for himself (which he did no way) but to curses of his life, as one that detested himself. For finding himself not only unhappy, but unhappy after being fallen from all happiness; and to be fallen from all happiness not by any misconceiving but by his own fault, and his fault to be done to no other but to Pamela, he did not tender his own estate but despised it, greedily drawing into his mind all conceits which might more and more torment him. And so remained he two days in the woods, disdaining to give his body food or his mind comfort, loving in himself nothing but the love of her. And indeed that love only strave with the fury of his anguish, telling it that if it destroyed Dorus, it should also destroy the image of her that lived in Dorus: and when the thought of that was crept in unto him, it began to win of him some compassion to the shrine of that image, and to bewail not for himself (whom he hated) but that so notable a love should perish. Then began he only so far to wish his own good as that Pamela might pardon him the fault, though not the punishment; and the uttermost height he aspired unto was that after his death she might yet pity his error and know that it proceeded of love and not of boldness.
   That conceit found such friendship in his thoughts that at last he yielded, since he was banished her presence, to seek some means by writing to show his sorrow and testify his repentance. Therefore getting him the necessary instruments of writing, he thought best to counterfeit his hand (fearing that as already she knew his, she would cast it away as soon as she saw it) and to put it in verse, hoping that would draw her on to read the more, choosing the elegiac as fittest for mourning. But never pen did more quakingly perform his office; never was paper mere double-moistened with ink and tears; never words more slowly married together, and never the Muses more tired than now with changes and rechanges of his devices; fearing how to end before he had resolved how to begin, mistrusting each word, condemning each sentence. This word was not significant; that word was too plain: this would not be conceived; the other would be ill-conceived: here sorrow was not enough expressed; there he seemed too much for his own sake to be sorry: this sentence rather showed art than passion; that sentence rather foolishly passionate than forcibly moving.
   At last, marring with mending and putting out better than he left, he made an end of it and being ended, was divers times ready to tear it, till his reason assuring him the more he studied the worse it grew, he folded it up, devoutly invoking good acceptation unto it; and watching his time, when they were all gone one day to dinner, saving Mopsa, to the other lodge, stale up into Pamela’s chamber, and in her standish (which first he kissed and craved of it a safe and friendly keeping) left it there to be seen at her next using her ink (himself returning again to be true prisoner to desperate sorrow) leaving her standish upon her beds-head to give her the more occasion to mark it; which also fell out.
   For she, finding it at her afternoon return in another place than she left it, opened it. But when she saw the letter, her heart gave her from whence it came; and therefore clapping it to again she went away from it as if it had been a contagious garment of an infected person: and yet was not long away but that she wished she had read it, though she were loth to read it.
   ‘Shall I,’ said she, ‘second his boldness so far as to read his presumptuous letters? And yet,' said she, ‘he sees me not now, to grow the bolder thereby: and how can I tell whether they be presumptuous?’ The paper came from him, and therefore not worthy to be received; and yet the paper, she thought, was not guilty. At last, she concluded it were not much amiss to look it over, that she might out of his words pick some further quarrel against him. Then she opened it, and threw it away, and took it up again, till (ere she were aware) her eyes would needs read it, containing this matter:
Unto a caitiff wretch, whom long affliction holdeth,
And now fully believes help to be quite perished,
Grant yet, grant yet a look, to the last monument of his anguish,
O you (alas, do I find) cause of his only ruin.
Dread not a whit (O goodly cruel) that pity may enter 
Into thy heart by the sight of this Epistle I send,
And so refuse to behold of these strange wounds the recital,
Lest it might thee allure home to thyself to return —
(Unto thyself I do mean those graces dwell so within thee, 
Gratefulness, sweetness, holy love, hearty regard).
Such thing cannot I seek (despair hath giv’n me my answer, 
Despair most tragical clause to a deadly request);
Such thing cannot he hope, that knows thy determinate hardness, 
Hard like a rich marble; hard, but a fair diamond.
Can those eyes, that of eyes drown’d in most hearty flowing tears 
(Tears and tears of a man) had no return to remorse,
Can those eyes now yield to the kind conceit of a sorrow,
Which ink only relates, but ne laments ne replies?
Ah, that, that do I not conceive, though that to my bliss were 
More than Nestor’s years, more than a King's diadem.
Ah, that, that do I not conceive. To the Heaven when a mouse climbs,
Then may I hope to achieve grace of a heavenly tiger.
But, but alas, like a man condemned doth crave to be heard speak, 
Not that he hope- for amends of the disaster he feels,
But finding the approach of death with an inly relenting,
Gives an adieu to the world, as to his only delight:
Right so my boiling heart, inflam’d with fire of a fair eye,
Bubbling out doth breathe signs of his hugy dolours,
Now that he finds to what end his life and love be reserved,
And that he thence must part, where to live only he liv'd.
O fair, O fairest, are such the triumphs to thy fairness?
Can death beauty become? Must I be such a monument?
Must I be only the mark shall prove that virtue is angry,
Shall prove that fierceness can with a white dove abide,
Shall to the world appear that faith and love be rewarded 
With mortal disdain, bent to unendly revenge?
Unto revenge? O sweet, on a wretch wilt thou be revenged?
Shall such high planets tend to the loss of a worm?
And to revenge who do bend would in that kind be revenged 
As th' offence was done, and go beyond if he can. 
All my offence was love: with love then must I be chastened;
And with more, by the laws that to revenge do belong.
If that love be a fault, more fault in you to be lovely:
Love never had me oppressed, but that I saw to be lov’d.
You be the cause that I lov’d. What Reason blameth a shadow 
That with a body't goes, since by a body it is?
If that love you did hate, you should your beauty have hidden: 
You should those fair eyes have with a veil covered.
But fool, fool that I am, those eyes would shine from a dark cave: 
What veils then do prevail, but to a more miracle?
Or those golden locks, those locks which lock me to bondage,
Torn you should disperse unto the blasts of a wind.
But fool, fool that I am, though I had but a hair of her head found, 
Ev’n as I am, so I should unto that hair be a thrall.
Or with fair hands' nails (O hand which nails me to this death) 
You should have your face (since love is ill) blemished.
O wretch, what do I say? Should that fair face be defaced?
Should my too-much sight cause so true a sun to be lost?
First let Cimmerian darkness be my onl’ habitation:
First be mine eyes pull’d out, first be my brain perished,
Ere that I should consent to do so excessive a damage 
Unto the earth, by the hurt of this her heavenly jewel.
O not but such love you say you could have afforded,
As might learn temp'rance, void of a rage’s events.
O sweet simplicity: from whence should love be so learned?
Unto Cupid, that Boy, shall a pedant be found?
Well, but faulty I was. Reason to my passion yielded,
Passion unto my rage, rage to a hasty revenge.
But what’s this for a fault, for which such faith be abolished,
Such faith, so stainless, inviolate, violent?
Shall I not, O may I not thus yet refresh the remembrance,
What sweet joys I had once, and what a place I did hold?
Shall I not once object, that you, you granted a favour 
Unto the man, whom now such miseries you award?
Bend your thoughts to the dear sweet words which then to me giv’n were:
Think what a world is now, think who hath alt’red her heart. 
What, was I then worthy such good, now worthy such evil?
Now fled, then cherished? Then so nigh, now so remote?
Did not a rosed breath, from lips more rosy proceeding,
Say that I well should find in what a care I was had,
With much more? Now what do I find, but care to abhor me?
Care that I sink in grief, care that I live banished?
And banished do I live, nor now will seek a recovery,
Since so she will, whose will is to me more than a law.
If then a man in most ill case may give you a farewell,
Farewell, long farewell, all my woe, all my delight. 
   
   CHAPTER 2
   What this would have wrought in her she herself could not tell, for before her reason could moderate the disputation between favour and faultiness, her sister and Miso called her down to entertain Zelmane who was come to visit the two sisters, about whom, as about two poles, the sky of beauty was turned; while Gynecia wearied her bed with her melancholy sickness, and made Miso’s shrewdness (who like a spirit set to keep a treasure, barred Zelmane from any further conference) to be the lieutenant of her jealousy; both she and her husband driving Zelmane to such a strait of resolution, either of impossible granting or dangerous refusing, as the best escape she had was (as much as she could) to avoid their company. So as this day, being the fourth day after the uproar (Basilius being with his sick wife, conferring upon such examinations as Philanax and other of his noblemen had made of this late sedition, all touching Cecropia, with vehement suspicion of giving either flame or fuel unto it) Zelmane came with her body to find her mind, which was gone long before her and had gotten his seat in Philoclea, who now with a bashful cheerfulness (as though she were ashamed that she could not choose but be glad) joined with her sister in making much of Zelmane.
   And so as they sat devising how to give more feathers to the wings of time, there came to the lodge-door six maids, all in one livery of scarlet petticoats which were tucked up almost to their knees; the petticoats themselves being in many places garnished with leaves, their legs naked, saving that above the ankles they had little black silk laces upon which did hang a few silver bells, like which they had a little above their elbows upon their bare arms. Upon their hair they wore garlands of roses and gilliflowers, and the hair was so dressed as that came again above the garlands, interchanging a mutual covering so as it was doubtful whether the hair dressed the garlands, or the garlands dressed the hair. Their breasts liberal to the eye; the face of the foremost of them in excellency fair and of the rest lovely, if not beautiful; and beautiful might have been, if they had not suffered greedy Phoebus over- often and hard to kiss them. Their countenances full of a graceful gravity, so as the gesture matched with the apparel, it might seem a wanton modesty and an enticing soberness. Each of them had an instrument of music in their hands which, consorting their well- pleasing tunes, did charge each ear with unsensibleness that did not lend itself unto them. The music entering alone into the lodge, the ladies were all desirous to see from whence so pleasant a guest was come; and therefore went out together, where, before they could take the pains to doubt, much less to ask the question of their quality, the fairest of them (with a gay, but yet discreet demeanour) in this sort spake unto them.
   ‘Most excellent ladies (whose excellencies have power to make cities envy these woods, and solitariness to be accounted the sweetest company) vouchsafe our message your gracious hearing, which, as it comes from love, so comes it from lovely persons. The maids of all this coast of Arcadia, understanding the often access that certain shepherds of these quarters are allowed to have in this forbidden place, and that their rural sports are not disdained of you, have been stirred with emulation to them and affection to you, to bring forth something which might as well breed your contentment: and therefore hoping that the goodness of their intention, and the hurtlessness of their sex shall excuse the breach of the commandment in coming to this place unsent for, they chose out us to invite both your princely parents and yourselves to a place in the woods about half a mile hence, where they have provided some such sports as they trust your gracious acceptations will interpret to be delightful. We have been at the other lodge, but finding them there busied in weightier affairs, our trust is that you yet will not deny the shining of your eyes upon us.'
   The ladies stood in some doubt whether they should go or not, lest Basilius might be angry withal. But Miso (that had been at none of the pastorals, and had a great desire to lead her old senses abroad to some pleasure) told them plainly they should nor will nor choose, but go thither, and make the honest country people know that they were not so squeamish as folks thought of them. The ladies, glad to be warranted by her authority, with a smiling humbleness obeyed her; Pamela only casting a seeking look whether she could see Dorus (who, poor wretch, wandered half mad for sorrow in the woods, crying for pardon of her who could not bear him) but indeed was grieved for his absence, having given the wound to him through her own heart. But so the three ladies and Miso went with those six Nymphs, conquering the length of the way with the force of music, leaving only Mopsa behind, who disgraced weeping with her countenance, because her mother would not suffer her to show her new-scoured face among them. But the place appointed, as they thought, met them half in their way, so well were they pleased with the sweet tunes and pretty conversation of their inviters. There found they in the midst of the thickest part of the wood a little square place, not burdened with trees, but with a board covered and beautified with the pleasantest fruits that sun-burned Autumn could deliver unto them. The maids besought the ladies to sit down and taste of the swelling grapes, which seemed great with child of Bacchus, and of the divers coloured plums, which gave the eye a pleasant taste before they came to the mouth. The ladies would not show to scorn their provision, but ate and drank a little of their cool wine, which seemed to laugh for joy to come to such lips,
   But after the collation was ended and that they looked for the coming forth of such devices as were prepared for them, there rushed out of the woods twenty armed men, who round about environed them, and laying hold of Zelmane before she could draw her sword, and taking it from her, put hoods over the heads of all four, and so muffled, by force set them on horse-back, and carried them away; the sisters in vain crying for succour, while Zelmane’s heart was rent in pieces with rage of the injury and disdain of her fortune. But when they had carried them a four or five mile further, they left Miso with a gag in her mouth and bound hand and foot, so to take her fortune, and brought the three ladies (by that time that the night seemed with her silence to conspire to their treason) to a castle about ten mile from the lodges, where they were fain to take a boat which waited for them, for the castle stood in the midst of a great lake upon a high rock, where partly by art, but principally by nature, it was by all men esteemed impregnable.
   But at the castle-gate their faces were discovered, and there were met with a great number of torches, after whom the sisters knew their aunt-in-law Cecropia. But that sight increased the deadly terror of the princesses, looking for nothing but death since they were in the power of the wicked Cecropia; who yet came unto them, making courtesy the outside of mischief, and desiring them not to be discomforted for they were in a place dedicated to their service. Philoclea (with a look where love shined through the mist of fear) besought her to be good unto them, having never deserved evil of her. But Pamela’s high heart disdaining humbleness to injury, 'Aunt,' said she, ‘what you have determined of us I pray you do it speedily. For my part I look for no service, where I find violence.’
   But Cecropia, using no more words with them, conveyed them all three to several lodgings (Zelmane’s heart so swelling with spite that she could not bring forth a word) and so left them; first taking from them their knives because they should do themselves no hint, before she had determined of them: and then giving such order that they wanted nothing but liberty and comfort, she went to her son, who yet kept his bed because of his wound he had received of Zelmane, and told him whom now he had in his power. Amphialus was but even then returned from far countries where he had won immortal fame both of courage and courtesy, when he met with the princesses and was hurt by Zelmane, so as he was utterly ignorant of all his mother’s wicked devices, to which he would never have consented, being (like a rose out of a briar) an excellent son of an evil mother: and now, when he heard of this, was as much amazed as if he had seen the sun fall to the earth. And therefore desired his mother that she would tell him the whole discourse, how all these matters had happened.
   ‘Son,’ said she, ‘I will do it willingly, and since all is done for you I will hide nothing from you. And howsoever I might be ashamed to tell it strangers who would think it wickedness, yet what is done for your sake (how evil soever to others) to you is virtue. To begin then even with the beginning: this doting fool Basilius that now reigns, having lived unmarried until he was nigh threescore years old (and in all his speeches affirming, and in all his doings assuring, that he never would marry) made all the eyes of this country to be bent upon your father, his only brother, but younger by thirty years, as upon the undoubted successor; being indeed a man worthy to reign, thinking nothing enough for himself, where this goose (you see) puts down his head before there be anything near to touch him. So that he, holding place and estimation as heir of Arcadia, obtained me of my father, the king of Argos, his brother helping to the conclusion with protesting his bachelorly intention - for else, you may be sure, the king of Argos nor his daughter would have suffered their royal blood to be stained with the base name of subjection.
   ‘So that I came into this country as apparent princess thereof, and accordingly was courted and followed of all the ladies of this country. My port and pomp did well become a king of Argos’ daughter: in my presence their tongues were turned into ears, and their ears were captives unto my tongue. Their eyes admired my majesty, and happy was he or she on whom I would suffer the beams thereof to fall. Did I go to church, it seemed the very gods waited for me, their devotions not being solemnized till I was ready. Did I walk abroad to see any delight, nay, my walking was the delight itself, for to it was the concourse, one thrusting upon another who might show himself most diligent and serviceable towards me. My sleeps were inquired after, and my wakings never unsaluted: the very gate of my house full of principal persons, who were glad if their presents had received a grateful acceptation. And in this felicity wert thou born, the very earth submitting itself unto thee to be trodden on as by his prince; and to that pass had my husband’s virtue (by my good help) within short time brought it, with a plot we laid, as we should not have needed to have waited the tedious work of a natural end of Basilius, when the heavens (I think envying my great felicity) then stopped thy father's breath, when he breathed nothing but power and sovereignty. Yet did not thy orphancy or my widowhood deprive us of the delightful prospect which the hill of honour doth yield, while expectation of thy succession did bind dependencies unto us.
   ‘But before, my son, thou wert come to the age to feel the sweetness of authority, this beast (whom I can never name with patience) falsely and foolishly married this Gynecia, then a young girl, and brought her to sit above me in all feasts, to turn her shoulder to me-ward in all our solemnities. It is certain it is not so great a spite to be surmounted by strangers as by one's own allies. Think then what my mind was, since withal there is no question, the fall is greater from the first to the second than from the second to the undermost. The rage did swell in my heart so much the more as it was fain to be suppressed in silence and disguised with humbleness. But above all the rest, the grief of griefs was when with these two daughters, now thy prisoners, she cut off all hope of thy succession. It was a tedious thing to me that my eyes should look lower than anybody’s, that (myself being by) another’s voice than mine should be more respected. But it was insupportable unto me to think that not only I, but thou, should’st spend all thy time in such misery, and that the sun should see my eldest son less than a prince. And though I had been a saint I could not choose finding the change this change of fortune bred unto me; for now from the multitude of followers, silence grew to be at my gate and absence in my presence. The guess of my mind could prevail more before, than now many of my earnest requests. And thou, my dear son, by the fickle multitude no more than an ordinary person (born of the mud of the people) regarded.
   ‘But I (remembering that in all miseries weeping becomes fools, and practice wise folks) have tried divers means to pull us out of the mire of subjection. And though many times fortune failed me, yet did I never fail myself. Wild beasts I kept in a cave hard by the lodges, which I caused by night to be fed in the place of their pastorals - I as then living in my house hard by the place - and against the hour they were to meet (having kept the beasts without meat) then let them loose, knowing that they would seek their food there and devour what they found. But blind fortune, hating sharp-sighted inventions, made them unluckily to be killed. After, I used my servant Clinias to stir a notable tumult of country people; but those louts were too gross instruments for delicate conceits. Now lastly, finding Philanax’s examinations grow dangerous, I thought to play double or quit, and with a sleight I used of my fine-witted wench Artesia, with other maids of mine, would have sent those goodly inheritrixes of Arcadia to have pleaded their cause before Pluto, but that over-fortunately for them, you made me know the last day how vehemently this childish passion of love doth torment you. Therefore I have brought them unto you, yet wishing rather hate than love in you. For hate often begetteth victory, love commonly is the instrument of subjection. It is true that I would also by the same practice have entrapped the parents, but my maids failed of it, not daring to tarry long about it. But this sufficeth, since (these being taken away) you are the undoubted inheritor, and Basilius will not long over-live this loss.’
   ‘O mother,’ said Amphialus, ‘speak not of doing them hint, no more than to mine eyes or my heart, or if I have anything more dear than eyes or heart unto me. Let others find what sweetness they will in ever fearing because they ever are feared. For my part, I will think myself highly entitled, if I may be once by Philoclea accepted for a servant.’
   'Well,' said Cecropia, ‘I would I had bom you of my mind as well as of my body: then should you not have sunk under these base weaknesses. But since you have tied your thoughts in so wilful a knot, it is happy my policy hath brought matters to such a pass as you may both enjoy affection, and upon that build your sovereignty.’
   ‘Alais,’ said Amphialus, ‘my heart would fain yield you thanks for setting me in the way of felicity, but that fear kills them in me before they are fully bom. For if Philoclea be displeased, how can I be pleased? If she count it unkindness, shall I give tokens of kindness? Perchance she condemns me of this action, and shall I triumph? Perchance she drowns now the beauties I love with sorrowful tears, and where is then my rejoicing?'
   ‘You have reason,’ said Cecropia with a feigned gravity. ‘I will therefore send her away presently that her contentment may be recovered.'
   ‘No, good mother,’ said Amphialus, ‘since she is here, I would not for my life constrain presence, but rather would I die than consent to absence.’
   ‘Pretty intricate follies,’ said Cecropia, but get you up and see how you can prevail with her, while I go to the other sister. For after, we shall have our hands full to defend ourselves if Basilius hap to besiege us.’
   But remembering herself she turned back and asked him what he would have done with Zelmane, since now he might be revenged of his hurt. ‘Nothing but honourably,’ answered Amphialus, ‘having deserved no other of me, especially being (as I hear) greatly cherished of Philoclea, and therefore I could wish they were lodged together.'
   ‘O no,’ said Cecropia, ‘company confirms resolutions, and loneliness breeds a weariness of one’s thoughts, and so a sooner consenting to reasonable proffers.'
   CHAPTER 3
   But Amphialus (taking off his mother Philoclea’s knives, which he kept as a relic since she had worn them) gat up, and calling for his richest apparel, nothing seemed sumptuous enough for his mistress’ eyes; and that which was costly, he feared were not dainty; and though the invention were delicate, he misdoubted the making. As careful he was too of the colour, lest if gay, he might seem to glory in his injury and her wrong; if mourning, it might strike some evil presage unto her of her fortune. At length he took a garment more rich than glaring, the ground being black velvet, richly embroidered with great pearl and precious stones, but they set so among certain tufts of cypress that the cypress was like black clouds through which the stars might yield a dark lustre. About his neck he ware a broad and gorgeous collar whereof the pieces interchangeably answering, the one was of diamonds and pearl set with a white enamel so as by the cunning of the workman it seemed like a shining ice, and the other piece being of rubies and opals, had a fiery glistering; which he thought pictured the two passions of fear and desire wherein he was enchained. His hurt, not yet fully well, made him a little halt, but he strave to give the best grace he could unto his halting.
   And in that sort he went to Philoclea’s chamber: whom he found (because her chamber was over-lightsome) sitting of that side of her bed which was from the window, which did cast such a shadow upon her as a good painter would bestow upon Venus, when under the trees she bewailed the murder of Adonis: her hands and fingers (as it were) indented one within the other; her shoulder leaning to her bed's head, and over her head a scarf which did eclipse almost half her eyes, which under it fixed their beams upon the wall by, with so steady a manner as if in that place they might well change but not mend their object: and so remained they a good while after his coming in, he not daring to trouble her nor she perceiving him; till that (a little varying her thoughts, something quickening her senses) she heard him as he happed to stir his upper garment, and perceiving him, rose up with a demeanour where, in the book of beauty, there was nothing to be read but sorrow, for kindness was blotted out and anger was never there.
   But Amphialus, that had entrusted his memory with long and forcible speeches, found it so locked up in amazement that he could pick nothing out of it but the beseeching her to take what was done in good part, and to assure herself there was nothing but honour meant unto her person. But she, making no other answer, but letting her hands fall one from the other which before were joined (with eyes something cast aside, and a silent sigh) gave him to understand that considering his doings, she thought his speech as full of incongruity as her answer would be void of purpose: whereupon he kneeling down and kissing her hand (which she suffered with a countenance witnessing captivity but not kindness) he besought her to have pity of him whose love went beyond the bounds of conceit, much more of uttering: that in her hands the balance of his life or death did stand, whereto the least motion of hers would serve to determine, she being indeed the mistress of his life and he her eternal slave; and with true vehemency besought her that he might hear her speak: whereupon she suffered her sweet breath to turn itself into these kind of words.
   ‘Alas, cousin,' said she, ‘what shall my tongue be able to do which is informed by the ears one way and by the eyes another? You call for pity and use cruelty; you say you love me, and yet do the effects of enmity. You affirm your death is in my hands, but you have brought me to so near a degree to death as when you will, you may lay death upon me; so that while you say I am mistress of your life, I am not mistress of mine own. You entitle yourself my slave, but I am sine I am yours. If then violence, injury, terror, and depriving of that which is more dear than life itself, liberty, be fit orators for affection, you may expect that I will be easily persuaded. But if the nearness of our kindred breed any remorse in you, or there be any such thing in you which you call love toward me, then let not my fortune be disgraced with the name of imprisonment: let not my heart   itself by being vexed with feeling evil, and fearing worse. Let not me be a cause of my parents’ woeful destruction; but restore me to myself, and so doing, I shall account I have received myself of you. And what I say for myself, I say for my dear sister, and my friend Zelmane, for I desire no well-being without they may be partakers.’ With that her tears rained down from her heavenly eyes, and seemed to water the sweet and beautiful flowers of her face.
   But Amphialus was like the poor woman who, loving a tame doe she had above all earthly things, having long played withal and made it feed at her hand and lap, is constrained at length by famine (all her flock being spent and she fallen into extreme poverty) to kill the deer to sustain her life. Many a pitiful look doth she cast upon it, and many a time doth she draw back her hand before she can give the stroke. For even so Amphialus by a hunger-starved affection was compelled to offer this injury, and yet the same affection made him with a tormenting grief think unkindness in himself that he could find in his heart any way to restrain her freedom. But at length, neither able to grant nor deny, he thus answered her:
   ‘Dear lady,’ said he, ‘I will not say unto you (how justly soever Imay do it) that I am neither author nor accessory unto this your withholding; for since I do not redress it, I am as faulty as if I had begun it. But this I protest unto you (and this protestation of mine let the heavens hear, and if I lie, let them answer me with a deadly thunderbolt) that in my soul I wish I had never seen the light, or rather, that I had never had a father to beget such a child, than that by my means those eyes should overflow their own beauties, than by my means the sky of your virtue should be overclouded with sorrow. But woe is me, most excellent lady, I find myself most willing to obey you: neither truly do mine ears receive the least word you speak with any less reverence than as absolute and unresistable commandments. But alas, that tyrant love (which now possesseth the hold of all my life and reason) will no way suffer it. It is love, it is love, not I which disobey you. What then shall I say, but that I, who am ready to he under your feet, to venture, nay to lose my life at your least commandment, I am not the stay of your freedom, but love, love, which ties you in your own knots. It is you yourself that imprison yourself: it is your beauty which makes these castle-walls embrace you: it is your own eyes which reflect upon themselves this injury. Then is there no other remedy but that you some way vouchsafe to satisfy this love’s vehemency which, since it grew in yourself, without question you shall find it (far more than I) tractable.’
   But with these words Philoclea fell to so extreme a quaking, and her lively whiteness did degenerate to such a deadly paleness, that Amphialus feared some dangerous trance: so that taking her hand, and feeling that it (which was wont to be one of the chief firebrands of Cupid) had all the sense of it wrapt up in coldness, he began humbly to beseech her to put away all fear, and to assure herself, upon the vow he made thereof unto God and herself, that the uttermost forces he would ever employ to conquer her affection should be desire and desert. That promise brought Philoclea again to herself, so that slowly lifting up her eyes upon him, with a countenance ever courteous but then languishing, she told him that he should do well to do so, if indeed he had ever tasted what true love was: for that where now she did bear him goodwill, she should, if he took any other way, hate and abhor the very thought of him; assuring him withal that though his mother had taken away her knives, yet the house of death had so many doors as she would easily fly into it if ever she found her honour endangered.
   Amphialus, having the cold ashes of care cast upon the coals of desire, leaving some of his mother’s gentlewomen to wait upon Philoclea, himself indeed a prisoner to his prisoner and making all his authority to be but a foot-stool to humbleness, went from her to his mother. To whom with words, which affection indited but amazement uttered, he delivered what had passed between him and Philoclea, beseeching her to try what her persuasions could do with her, while he gave order for all such things as were necessary against such forces as he looked daily Basilius would bring before his castle. His mother bade him quiet himself, for she doubted not to take fit times: but that the best way was first to let her own passion a little tire itself.
   CHAPTER 4
   So they, calling Clinias and some other of their council, advised upon their present affairs. First, he dispatched private letters to all those principal lords and gentlemen of the country whom he thought either alliance or friendship to himself might draw with special motions from the general consideration of duty; not omitting all such whom either youthful age or youthlike minds did fill with unlimited desires, besides such whom any discontentment made hungry of change, or an overspended want made want a civil war: to each (according to the counsel of his mother) conforming himself after their humours. To his friends, friendliness; to the ambitious, great expectations; to the displeased, revenge; to the greedy, spoil: wrapping their hopes with such cunning as they rather seemed given over unto them as partakers than promises sprung of necessity. Then sent he to his mother's brother, the king of Argos; but he was as then so over-laid with war himself as from thence he could attend small succour.
   But because he knew how violently rumours do blow the sails of popular judgements, and how few there be that can discern between truth and truth-likeness, between shows and substance, he caused a justification of this his action to be written, whereof were sowed abroad many copies which, with some glosses of probability, might hide indeed the foulness of his treason, and from true common-places fetch down most false applications. For beginning how much the duty which is owed to the country goes beyond all other duties since in itself it contains them all, and that for the respect thereof, not only all tender respects of kindred or whatsoever other friendships are to be laid aside, but that even long-held opinions (rather builded upon a secret of government than any ground of truth) are to be forsaken; he fell by degrees to show that since the end whereto anything is directed is ever to be of more noble reckoning than the thing thereto directed, that therefore the weal-public was more to be regarded than any person or magistrate that thereunto was ordained: the feeling consideration whereof had moved him (though as near of kin to Basilius as could be) yet to set principally before his eyes the good estate of so many thousands over whom Basilius reigned, rather than so to hood-wink himself with affection as to suffer the realm to run to manifest ruin. The care whereof did kindly appertain to those who, being subaltern magistrates and officers of the crown, were to be employed as from the prince, so for the people; and of all other, especially himself who being descended of the royal race and next heir male, Nature had no sooner opened his eyes, but that the soil whereupon they did look was to look for at his hands a continual carefulness: which as from his childhood he had ever carried, so now finding that his uncle had not only given over all care of government, but had put it into the hands of Philanax (a man neither in birth comparable to many, nor for his corrupt, proud, and partial dealing, liked of any) but beside, had set his daughters (in whom the whole estate, as next heirs thereunto, had no less interest than himself) in so unfit and ill-guarded a place, as it was not only dangerous for their persons but (if they should be conveyed to any foreign country) to the whole commonwealth pernicious: that therefore he had brought them into this strong castle of his, which way, if it might seem strange, they were, to consider that new necessities require new remedies; but there they should be served and honoured as belonged to their greatness until by the general assembly of the estates it should be determined how they should to their best (both private and public) advantage be matched: vowing all faith and duty both to the father and children, never by him to be violated. But if in the meantime, before the estates could be assembled, he should be assailed, he would then for his own defence take arms; desiring all that either tendered the dangerous case of their country or in their hearts loved justice to defend him in this just action. And if the prince should command them otherwise, yet to know that therein he was no more to be obeyed than if he should call for poison to hurt himself withal; since all that was done was done for his service, howsoever he might (seduced by Philanax) interpret of it: he protesting that whatsoever he should do for his own defence should be against Philanax, and no way against Basilius.
   To this effect, amplified with arguments and examples, and painted with rhetorical colours, did he sow abroad many discourses which, as they prevailed with some of more quick than sound conceit to run his fortune with him, so in many did it breed a coolness to deal violently against him, and a false-minded neutrality to expect the issue. But besides the ways he used to weaken the adverse party, he omitted nothing for the strengthening of his own. The chief trust whereof (because he wanted men to keep the field) he reposed in the surety of his castle, which at least would win him much time, the mother of many mutations. To that therefore he bent both his outward and inward eyes, striving to make art strive with Nature to whether of them two that fortification should be most beholding. The seat Nature bestowed, but art gave the building which, as his rocky hardness would not yield to undermining force, so to open assaults he took counsel of skill how to make all approaches, if not impossible, yet difficult; as well at the foot of the castle as round about the lake, to give unquiet lodgings to them whom only enmity would make neighbours. Then omitted he nothing of defence, as well simple defence as that which did defend by offending, fitting instruments of mischief to places whence the mischief might be most liberally bestowed. Neither was his smallest care for victuals, as well for the providing that which should suffice, both in store and goodness, as in well preserving it and wary distributing it, both in quantity and quality, spending that first which would keep least.
   But wherein he sharpened his wits to the piercingest point was touching his men, knowing them to be the weapon of weapons and master-spring, as it were, which makes all the rest to stir; and that therefore in the art of man stood the quintessence and ruling skill of all prosperous government, either peaceable or military. He chose in number as many as without pestering (and so danger of infection) his victual would serve for two years to maintain; all of able bodies, and some few of able minds to direct, not seeking many commanders, but contenting himself that the multitude should have obeying wits, everyone knowing whom he should command and whom he should obey, the place where, and the matter wherein; distributing each office as near as he could to the disposition of the person that should exercise it, knowing no love, danger nor discipline can suddenly alter an habit in nature. Therefore would he not employ the still man to a shifting practice, nor the liberal man to be a dispenser of his victuals, nor the kind- hearted man to be a punisher; but would exercise their virtues in sorts where they might be profitable, employing his chief care to know them all particularly, and thoroughly regarding also the constitution of their bodies; some being able better to abide watching, some hunger, some labour; making his benefit of each ability, and not forcing beyond power.
   Time to everything by just proportion he allotted, and as well in that as in everything else, no small error winked at, lest greater should be animated. Even of vices he made his profit, making the cowardly Clinias to have care of the watch, which he knew his own fear would make him very wakefully perform. And before the siege began, he himself caused rumours to be sowed and libels to be spread against himself, fuller of malice than witty persuasion; partly to know those that would be apt to stumble at such motions, that he might cull them from the faithfuller band, but principally, because in necessity they should not know (when any such thing were in earnest attempted) whether it were or not of his own invention. But even then (before the enemy’s face came near to breed any terror) did he exercise his men daily in all their charges, as if danger had presently presented his most hideous presence: himself rather instructing by example than precept, being neither more sparing in travail nor spending in diet than the meanest soldier; his hand and body disdaining no base matters nor shrinking from the heavy.
   The only odds was, that when others took breath, he sighed; and when others rested, he crossed his arms. For love, passing through the pikes of danger and tumbling itself in the dust of labour, yet still made him remember his sweet desire and beautiful image. Often when he had begun to command one, somewhat before half the sentence were ended, his inward guest did so entertain him that he would break it off, and a pretty while after end it when he had (to the marvel of the standers-by) sent himself in to talk with his own thoughts. Sometimes when his hand was lifted up to do something, as if with the sight of Gorgon’s head he had been suddenly turned into a stone, so would he there abide with his eyes planted and hand lifted, till at length coming to the use of himself, he would look about whether any had perceived him. Then would he accuse and in himself condemn all those wits that durst affirm idleness to be the well-spring of love:
   ‘O’, would he say, 'all you that affect the title of wisdom by ungrateful scorning the ornaments of Nature, am I now piping in a shadow? Or do slothful feathers now enwrap me? Is not hate before me and doubt behind me? Is not danger of the one side, and shame of the other? And do I not stand upon pain and travail, and yet over all, my affection triumphs? The more I stir about urgent affairs, the more methinhs the very stirring breeds a breath to blow the coals of my love. The more I exercise my thoughts, the more they increase the appetite of my desires. O sweet Philoclea — ’ (with that he would cast up his eyes, wherein some water did appear, as if they would wash themselves against they should see her) ‘thy heavenly face is my astronomy; thy sweet virtue, my sweet philosophy: let me profit therein, and farewell all other cogitations. But alas, my mind misgives me, for your planets bear a contrary aspect unto me. Woe, woe is me, they threaten my destruction. And whom do they threaten this destruction? Even him that loves them; and by what means will they destroy, but by loving them? O dear though killing eyes, shall death head his dart with the gold of Cupid’s arrow? Shall death take his aim from the rest of beauty? O beloved though hating Philoclea, how, if thou be’st merciful, hath cruelty stolen into thee? Or how, if thou be’st cruel, doth cruelty look more beautiful than ever mercy did? Or alas, is it my destiny that makes mercy cruel? Like an evil vessel which turns sweet liquor to sourness, so when thy grace falls upon me, my wretched constitution makes it become fierceness.’
   Thus would he exercise his eloquence when she could not hear him, and be dumb-stricken when her presence gave him fit occasion of speaking; so that his wit could find out no other refuge but the comfort and counsel of his mother, desiring her, whose thoughts were unperplexed, to use for his sake the most prevailing manners of intercession.
   CHAPTER 5
   Cecropia, seeing her son's safety depend thereon, though her pride much disdained the name of a desirer, took the charge upon her, not doubting the easy conquest of an unexpert virgin, who had already with subtilty and impudency begun to undermine a monarchy. Therefore, weighing Philoclea’s r'isolutions by the counterpoise of her own youthful thoughts which she then called to mind, she doubted not at least to make Philoclea receive the poison distilled in sweet liquor which she with little disguising had drunk up thirstily. Therefore she went softly to Philoclea’s chamber, and peeping through the side of the door, then being a little open, she saw Philoclea sitting low upon a cushion in such a given-over manner that one would have thought silence, solitariness and melancholy were come there under the ensign of mishap, to conquer delight and drive him from his natural seat of beauty. Her tears came dropping down like rain in sunshine, and she not taking heed to wipe the tears, they ran down upon her cheeks and lips as upon cherries which the dropping tree be- deweth. In the dressing of her hair and apparel, she might see neither a careful art nor an art of carelessness, but even left to a neglected chance, which yet could no more unperfect her perfections than a die any way cast could lose its squareness.
   Cecropia, stirred with no other pity but for her son, came in, and haling kindness into her countenance, ‘What ails this sweet lady?' said she; ‘Will you mar so good eyes with weeping? Shall tears take away the beauty of that complexion which the women of Arcadia wish for and the men long after? Fie of this peevish sadness: insooth it is untimely for your age. Look upon your own body and see whether it deserve to pine away with sorrow. See whether you will have these hands’ (with that she took one of her hands and kissing it, looked upon it as if she were enamoured with it) ‘fade from their whiteness which makes one desire to touch them, and their softness which rebounds again a desire to look on them, and become dry, lean and yellow, and make everybody wonder at the change and say that sure you had used some art before which now you had left, for if the beauties had been natural, they would never so soon have been blemished. Take a glass and see whether those tears become your eyes, although, I must confess, those eyes are able to make tears comely.’
   ‘Alas, madam,’ answered Philoclea, ‘I know not whether my tears become mine eyes, but I am sure mine eyes thus beteared become my fortune.’
   Tour fortune,’ said Cecropia, ‘if she could see to attire herself, would put on her best raiments. For I see, and I see it with grief and (to tell you true) unkindness, you misconstrue everything that only for your sake is attempted. You think you are offended, and are, indeed, defended: you esteem yourself a prisoner and are, in truth, a mistress: you fear hate, and shall find love. And truly, I had a thing to say to you, but it is no matter since I find you are so obstinately melancholy as that you woo his fellowship. I will spare my pains and hold my peace.’ and so stayed indeed, thinking Philoclea would have had a female inquisitiveness of the matter. But she, who rather wished to unknow what she knew than to burden her heart with more hopeless knowledge, only desired her to have pity of her and if, indeed, she did mean her no hurt, then to grant her liberty, for else the very grief and fear would prove her unappointed executioners.
   ‘For that,’ said Cecropia, ‘believe me upon the faith of a king’s daughter, you shall be free, so soon as your freedom may be free of mortal danger, being brought hither for no other cause but to prevent such mischiefs as you know not of. But if you think, indeed, to win me to have care of you, even as of mine own daughter, then lend your ears unto me, and let not your mind arm itself with a wilfulness to be flexible to nothing, but if I speak reason, let reason have his due reward, persuasion. Then sweet niece,’ said she, ‘I pray you pre-suppose that now, even in the midst of your agonies which you paint unto yourself most horrible, wishing with sighs and praying with vows for a soon and safe delivery: imagine niece (I say) that some heavenly spirit should appear unto you and bid you follow him through the door that goes into the garden, assuring you that you should thereby return to your dear mother, and what other delights soever your mind esteems delights: would you (sweet niece) would you refuse to follow him, and say that if he led you not through the chief gate, you would not enjoy your over-desired liberty? Would you not drink the wine you thirst for, without it were in such a glass as you especially fancied? Tell me (dear niece) - but I will answer for you, because I know your reason and wit is such as must needs conclude that such niceness can no more be in you, to disgrace such a mind, than disgracefulness can have any place in so faultless a beauty. Your wisdom would assuredly determine how the mark were hit, not whether the bow were of yew or no wherein you shot If this be so, and thus sure (my dear niece) it is, then, I pray you, imagine that I am that same good angel who, grieving in your grief and, in truth, not able to suffer that bitter sighs should be sent forth with so sweet a breath, am come to lead you, not only to your desired and imagined happiness, but to a true and essential happiness; not only to liberty, but to liberty with commandment. The way I will show you; which if it be not the gate builded hitherto in your private choice, yet shall it be a door to bring you through a garden of pleasures as sweet as this life can bring forth; nay rather, which makes this life to be a life. My son (let it be no blemish to him that I name him my son who was your father’s own nephew, for you know I am no small king’s daughter) my son, I say, far passing the nearness of his kindred with nearness of goodwill, and striving to match your matchless beauty with a matchless affection, doth by me present unto you the full enjoying of your liberty, so as with this gift you will accept a greater, which is this castle, with all the rest which you know he hath in honourable quantity, and will confirm his gift and your receipt of both with accepting him to be yours. I might say much both for the person and the matter, but who will cry out the sun shines? It is so manifest a profit unto you as the meanest judgement must straight apprehend it; so far is it from the sharpness of yours, thereof to be ignorant. Therefore, sweet niece, let your gratefulness be my intercession and your gentleness my eloquence, and let me carry comfort to a heart which greatly needs it.’
   Philoclea looked upon her and cast down her eye again: ‘Aunt/ said she,  would I could be so much a mistress of my own mind as to yield to my cousin’s virtuous request, for so I construe of it. But my heart is already set’ (and staying a while on that word, she brought forth afterwards) ‘to lead a virgin’s life to my death; for such a vow I have in myself devoutly made/
   ‘The heavens prevent such a mischief,’ said Cecropia. ‘A vow, quoth you? No, no, my dear niece, Nature, when you were first bom, vowed you a woman, and as she made you child of a mother, so to do your best to be mother of a child. She gave you beauty to move love: she gave you wit to know love: she gave you an excellent body to reward love: which kind of liberal rewarding is crowned with an unspeakable ielicity. For this, as it bindeth the receiver, so it makes happy the bestower: this doth not impoverish but enrich the giver. O the sweet name of a motherl O the comfort of comforts to see your children grow up, in whom you are, as it were, eternized! If you could conceive what a heart-tickling joy it is to see your own little ones with aweful love come running to your lap, and like little models of yourself still carry you about them, you would think unkindness in your own thoughts that ever they did rebel against the mean unto it. But perchance I set rtiic blessedness before your eyes as captains do victory before their soldiers, to which they must come through many pains, griefs and dangers. No, I am content you shrink from this my counsel, if the way to come unto it be not most of all pleasant’
   ‘I know not,’ answered the sweet Philoclea, fearing lest silence would offend for sullenness, ‘what contentment you speak of; but am sure the best you can make of it (which is marriage) is a burdenous yoke.'
   ‘Ah, dear niece,’ said Cecropia, ‘how much you are deceived! A yoke, indeed, we all bear, laid upon us in our creation, which by marriage is not increased but thus far eased that you have a yokefellow to help to draw through the cloddy cumbers of this world. O widow-nights, bear witness with me of the difference! How often, alas, do I embrace the orphan-side of my bed which was wont to be imprinted by the body of my dear husband, and with tears acknowledge that I now enjoy such a liberty as the banished man hath, who may, if he list, wander over the world, but is for ever restrained from his most delightful home: that I have now such a liberty as the seeled dove hath which, being first deprived of eyes, is then by the falconer cast off. For believe me, niece, believe me, man’s experience is woman’s best eye-sight Have you ever seen a pure rose-water kept in a crystal glass, how fine it looks, how sweet it smells while that beautiful glass imprisons it? Break the prison, and let the water take its own course; doth it not embrace dust and lose all his former sweetness and fairness? Tru,r so are we, if we have not the stay, rather than the restraint, of crystalline marriage. My heart melts to think of the sweet comforts I in that happy time received, when  had never cause to care but the care was doubled, when I never rejoiced, but that I saw my joy shine in another’s eyes. What shall I say of the free delight which the heart might embrace without the accusing of the inward conscience or fear of outward shame? And is a solitary life as good as this? Then can one string make as good music as a consort: then can one colour set forth a beauty. But it may be the general consideration of marriage doth not so much mislike you as the applying of it to him. He is my son: I must confess I see him with a mother’s eyes, which if they do not much deceive me, he is no such one over whom contempt may make any just challenge. He is comely, he is noble, he is rich; but that which in itself should carry all comeliness, nobility and riches, he loves you; and he loves you who is beloved of others. Drive not away his affection, sweet lady, and make no other lady hereafter proudly brag that she hath robbed you of so faithful and notable a servant.’
   Philoclea heard some pieces of her speeches no otherwise than one doth when a tedious prattler cumbers the hearing of a delightful music. For her thoughts had left her ears in that captivity, and conveyed themselves to behold (with such eyes as imagination could lend them) the estate of her Zelmane, for whom how well she thought many of those sayings might have been used with a far more grateful acceptation. Therefore listing not to dispute in a matter whereof herself was resolved and desired not to inform the other, she only told her that whilst she was so captivated, she could not conceive of any such persuasions (though never so reasonable) any otherwise than as constraints; and as constraints, must needs even in nature abhor them, which at her liberty, in their own force of reason, might more prevail with her; and so fain would have returned the strength of Cecropia’s persuasions to have procured freedom.
   CHAPTER 6
   But neither her witty words in an enemy, nor those words, made more than eloquent with passing through such Ups, could prevail in Cecropia, no more than her persuasions could win Philoclea to disavow her former vow, or to leave the prisoner Zelmane for the commanding Amphialus. So that both sides being desirers, and neither granters, they brake off conference; Cecropia sucking up more and more spite out of her denial, which yet for her son’s sake she disguised with a vizard of kindness, leaving no office unperformed which might either witness or endear her son’s affection. Whatsoever could be imagined likely to please her was with liberal diligence performed: musics at her window, and especially such musics as might (with doleful embassage) call the mind to think of sorrow, and think of it with sweetness; with ditties so sensibly expressing Amphialus’ case, that every word seemed to be but a diversifying of the name of Amphialus. Daily presents, as it were oblations to pacify an angry deity, sent unto her: wherein, if the workmanship of the form had striven with the sumptuousness of the matter, as much did the invention in the application contend to have the chief excellency; for they were as so many stories of his disgraces and her perfections; where the richness did invite the eyes, the fashion did entertain the eyes, and the device did teach the eyes the present misery of the presenter himself, awefully serviceable; which was the more notable as his authority was manifest. And for the bondage wherein she lived, all means used to make known that if it were a bondage, it was a bondage only knit in love-knots.
   But she in heart already understanding no language but one, the music wrought, indeed, a dolefulness, but it was a dolefulness to be in his power: the ditty intended for Amphialus she translated to Zelmane; the presents seemed so many tedious clogs of a thralled obligation; and his service, the more diligent it was, the more it did exprobrate, as she thought, unto her her unworthy estate, that even he that did her service had authority of commanding her; only construing her servitude in his own nature, esteeming it a right, and a right bitter servitude: so that all their shots (how well soever levelled) being carried awry from the mark by the storm of her mislike, the prince Amphialus affectionately languished, and Cecropia, spitefully cunning, disdained at the barrenness of their success.
   Which willingly Cecropia would have revenged, but that she saw her hurt could not be divided from her son’s mischief: wherefore she bethought herself to attempt Pamela, whose beauty being equal, she hoped if she might be won, that her son’s thoughts would rather rest on a beautiful gratefulness than still be tormented with a disdaining beauty. Therefore giving new courage to her wicked inventions, and using the more industry because she had missed in this, and taking even precepts of prevailing in Pamela by her fading in Philoclea, she went to her chamber, and (according to her own ungracious method of subtle proceeding) stood listening at the door, because that out of the circumstance of her present behaviour there might kindly arise a fit beginning of her intended discourse.
   And so she might perceive that Pamela did walk up and down, full of deep, though patient thoughts. For her look and countenance was settled, her pace soft and almost still of one measure, without any passionate gesture or violent motion: till at length, as it were, awaking and strengthening herself, ‘Well,’ said she, ‘yet this is the best, and of this I am sure, that howsoever they wrong me, they cannot over-master God. No darkness blinds His eyes, no jail bars Him out. To whom then else should I fly but to Him for succour?’ and therewith kneeling down even where she stood, she thus said:
   ‘O all-seeing light and eternal life of all things, to whom nothing is either so great that it may resist, or so small that it is contemned; look upon my misery with Thine eye of mercy, and let Thine infinite power vouchsafe to limit out some proportion of deliverance unto me, as to Thee shall seem most convenient. Let not injury, O Lord, triumph over me, and let my faults by Thy hand be corrected, and make not mine unjust enemy the minister of Thy justice. But yet, my God, if in Thy wisdom, this be the aptest chastisement for my unexcusable folly; if this low bondage be fittest for my over-high desires; if the pride of my not-enough humble heart be thus to be broken, O Lord, I yield unto Thy will, and joyfully embrace what sorrow Thou wilt have me suffer. Only thus much let me crave of Thee (let my craving, O Lord, be accepted of Thee since ven that proceeds from Thee) let me crave even by the noblest title which in my greatest affliction I may give myself (that I am Thy creature) and by Thy goodness (which is Thyself) that Thou wilt suffer some beam of Thy majesty so to shine into my mind, that it may still depend confidently upon Thee. Let calamity be the exercise, but not the overthrow of my virtue: let their power prevail, but prevail not to destruction: let my greatness be their prey: let my pain be the sweetness of their revenge: let them (if so it seem good unto Thee) vex me with more and more punishment. But, O Lord, let never their wickedness have such a hand, but that I may carry a pure mind in a pure body,’ (and pausing awhile) ‘And, O most gracious Lord,’ said she, ‘whatever become of me, preserve the virtuous Musidorus.’
   The other part Cecropia might well hear, but this latter prayer for Musidorus, her heart held it as so jewel-like a treasure that it would scarce trust her own lips withal. But this prayer sent to heaven from so heavenly a creature, with such a fervent grace as if devotion had borrowed her body to make of itself a most beautiful representation; with her eyes so lifted to the skyward that one would have thought they had begun to fly thitherward to take their place among their fellow stars; her naked hands raising up their whole length and, as it were, kissing one another, as if the right had been the picture of Zeal, and the left of Humbleness, which both united themselves to make their suits more acceptable: lastly, all her senses being rather tokens than instruments of her inward motions - altogether had so strange a working power that even the hardhearted wickedness of Cecropia, if it found not a love of that goodness, yet it felt an abashment at that goodness; and if she had not a kindly remorse, yet had she an irksome accusation of her own naughtiness, so that she was put from the bias of her foreintended lesson. For well she found there was no way at that time to take that mind but with some, at least, image of virtue; and what the figure thereof was her heart knew not.
   Yet did she prodigally spend her uttermost eloquence, leaving no argument unprovided which might with any force invade her excellent judgement: the justness of the request being but for marriage; the worthiness of the suitor; then her own present fortune, which should not only have amendment but felicity; besides falsely making her believe that her sister would think herself happy if now she might have his love, which before she contemned; and obliquely touching what danger it should be for her if her son should accept Philoclea in marriage and so match the next heir apparent, she being in his power: yet plentifully perjuring how extremely her son loved her, and excusing the little shows he made of it with the dutiful respect he bare unto her, and taking upon herself that she restrained him since she found she could set no limits to his passions. And as she did to Philoclea, so did she to her, with the tribute of gifts seek to bring her mind into servitude; and all other means that might either establish a beholdingness or at least awake a kindness: doing it so, as by reason of their imprisonment, one sister knew not how the other was wooed but each might think that only she was sought. But if Philoclea with sweet and humble dealing did avoid their assaults, she with the majesty of virtue did beat them off.
   CHAPTER 7
   But this day their speech was the sooner broken off, by reason that he who stood as watch upon the top of the Keep did not only see a great dust arise (which the earth sent up as if it would strive to have clouds as well as the air) but might spy sometimes, especially when the dust (wherein the naked wind did apparel itself) was carried aside from them, the shining of armour, like flashing of lightning wherewith the clouds did seem to be with child; which the sun gilding with his beams, it gave a sight delightful to any but to them that were to abide the terror. But the watch gave a quick alarum to the soldiers within, whom practice already having prepared, began each with unabashed hearts, or at least countenances, to look to their charge or obedience which was allotted unto them.
   Only Clinias and Amphialus did exceed the bounds of mediocrity, the one in his natural coldness of cowardice, the other in heat of courage. For Clinias (who was bold only in busy whisperings, and even in that whisperingness rather, indeed, confident in his cunning that it should not be betrayed than any way bold, if ever it should be betrayed) now that the enemy gave a dreadful aspect unto the castle, his eyes saw no terror nor ear heard any martial sound but that they multiplied the hideousness of it to his mated mind. Before their coming he had many times felt a dreadful expectation, but yet his mind (that was willing to ease itself of the burden of fear) did sometimes feign unto itself possibility of let, as the death of Basilius, the discord of the nobility; and (when other cause failed him) the nature of chance served as a cause unto him; and sometimes the hearing other men speak valiantly and the quietness of his unassailed senses would make himself believe that he durst do something. But now that present danger did display itself unto his eye and that a dangerous doing must be the only mean to prevent the danger of suffering, one that had marked him would have judged that his eyes would have run into him and his soul out of him, so unkindly did either take a scent of danger. He thought the lake was too shallow and the walls too thin: he misdoubted each man’s treason, and conjectured every possibility of misfortune, not only forecasting likely perils but such as all the planets together could scarcely have conspired; and already began to arm himself, though it was determined he should tarry within doors; and while he armed himself, imagined in what part of the vault he would hide himself if the enemies won the castle. Desirous he was that everybody should do valiantly but himself, and therefore was afraid to show his fear, but for very fear would have hid his fear lest it should discomfort others; but the more he sought to disguise it, the more the unsuitableness of a weak broken voice to high brave words, and of a pale shaking countenance to a gesture of animating, did discover him.
   But quite contrarily Amphialus, who, before the enemies came, was careful, providently diligent and not sometimes without doubting of the issue, now the nearer danger approached (like the light of a glow-worm) the less still it seemed: and now his coinage began to boil in choler and with such impatience to desire to pour out both upon the enemy, that he issued presently into certain boats he had of purpose, and carrying with him some choice men, went to the fortress he had upon the edge of the lake, which he thought would be the first thing that the enemy would attempt, because it was a passage which, commanding all that side of the country and being lost, would stop victuals or other supply that might be brought into the castle: and in that fortress having some force of horsemen, he issued out with two hundred horse and five hundred footmen; ambushed his footmen in the falling of a hill which was over-shadowed with a wood; he with his horsemen went a quarter of a mile further, aside-hand of which he might perceive the many troops of the enemy who came but to take view where best to encamp themselves.
   But as if the sight of the enemy had been a magnes-stone to his courage, he could not contain himself, but showing his face to the enemy and his back to his soldiers, used that action as his only oration, both of denouncing war to the one and persuading help from the other: who faithfully following an example of such authority, they made the earth to groan under their furious burden, and the enemies to begin to be angry with them whom in particular they knew not Among whom there was a young man, youngest brother to Philanax, whose face as yet did not betray his sex with so much as show of hair; of a mind having no limits of hope nor knowing why to fear; full of jollity in conversation, and lately grown a lover. His name was Agenor, of all that army the most beautiful: who having ridden in sportful conversation among the foremost, all armed, saving that his beaver was up to have his breath in more freedom, seeing Amphialus come a pretty way before his company, neither staying the commandment of the captain, nor recking whether his face were armed or no, set spurs to his horse, and with youthful bravery casting his staff about his head, put it then in his rest as careful of comely carrying it as if the mark had been but a ring and the lookers-on ladies. But Amphialus’ lance was already come to the last of his descending line, and began to make the full point of death against the head of this young gentleman, when Amphialus perceiving his youth and beauty, compassion so rebated the edge of choler that he spared that fair nakedness, and let his staff fall to Agenor’s vamplate: so as both with brave breaking should hurtlessly have performed that match, but that the pitiless lance of Amphialus (angry with being broken) with an unlucky counterbuff, full of unsparing splinters, lighted upon that face, far fitter for the combats of Venus, giving not only a sudden, but a foul death, leaving scarcely any tokens of his former beauty; but his hands abandoning the reins and his thighs the saddle, he fell sideward from the horse. Which sight coming to Leontius, a dear friend of his, who in vain had lamentably cried unto him to stay when he saw him begin his career, it was hard to say whether pity of the one or revenge against the other held as then the sovereignty in his passions. But while he directed his eye to his friend and his hand to his enemy, so wrongly-consorted a power could not resist the ready-minded force of Amphialus, who perceiving his ill-directed direction against him, so paid him his debt before it was lent, that he also fell to the earth, only happy that one place and one time did finish both their loves and lives together.
   But by this time there had been a furious meeting of either side, where, after the terrible salutation of warlike noise, the shaking of hands was with sharp weapons. Some lances, according to the metal they met and skill of the guider, did stain themselves in blood; some flew up in pieces, as if they would threaten heaven because they failed on earth. But their office was quickly inherited, either by (the prince of weapons) the sword, or by some heavy mace or biting axe which, hunting still the weakest chase, sought ever to light there where smallest resistance might worse prevent mischief. The clashing of armour, the crushing of staves, the jostling of bodies, the resounding of blows, was the first part of that ill-agreeing music which was beautified with the grisliness of wounds, the rising of dust, the hideous falls and groans of the dying. The very horses, angry in their masters’ anger, with love and obedience brought forth the effects of hate and resistance, and with minds of servitude did as if they affected glory. Some lay dead under their dead masters, whom unknightly wounds had unjustly punished for a faithful duty. Some lay upon their lords by like accidents, and in death had the honour to be borne by them, whom in life they had borne. Some, having lost their commanding burdens, ran scattered about the field, abashed with the madness of mankind. The earth itself (wont to be a burial of men) was now, as it were, buried with men; so was the face thereof hidden with dead bodies, to whom death had come masked in divers manners. In one place lay disinherited heads, dispossessed of their natural seignories; in another whole bodies to see to, but that their hearts, wont to be bound all over so close, were now with deadly violence opened: in others, fouler deaths had uglily displayed their trailing guts. There lay arms, whose fingers yet moved as if they would feel for him that made them feel; and legs, which contrary to common reason, by being discharged of their burden, were grown heavier. But no sword paid so large a tribute of souls to the eternal kingdom as that of Amphialus; who like a tiger from whom a company of wolves did seek to ravish a new gotten prey, so he (remembering they came to take away Philoclea) did labour to make valour, strength, choler and hatred to answer the proportion of his love which was infinite.
   There died of his hands the old knight Aeschylus, who though by years might well have been allowed to use rather the exercises of wisdom than of courage, yet having a lusty body and a merry heart, he ever took the summons of time in jest, or else it had so creepingly stolen upon him that he had heard scarcely the noise of his feet, and therefore was as fresh in apparel and as forward in enterprises as a far younger man: but nothing made him bolder than a certain prophecy had been told him that he should die in the arms of his son, and therefore feared the less the arm of an enemy. But now when Amphialus’ sword was passed through his throat, he thought himself abused but that before he died, his son, indeed, seeing his father begin to fall, held him up in his arms, till a pitiless soldier of the other side with a mace brained him, making father and son become twins in their never-again-dying birth.
   As for Drialus, Memnon, Nisus and Polycrates; the first had hie eyes cut out so as he could not see to bid the near-following death welcome: the second had met with the same prophet that old Aeschylus had, and having found many of his speeches true, believed this too, that he should never be killed but by his own companions: and therefore no man was more valiant than he against an enemy, no man more suspicious of his friends; so as he seemed to sleep in security wheu he went to a battle, and to enter into a battle when he began to sleep, such guards he would set about his person, yet mistrusting those very guards lest they would murder him. But now Amphialus helped to unriddle his doubts; for he overthrowing him from his horse, his own companions, coming with a fresh supply, pressed him to death. Nisus, grasping with Amphialus, was with a short dagger slain. And for Poly- crates, while he shunned as much as he could, keeping only his place for fear of punishment, Amphialus with a memorable blow strake off his head; where, with the convulsions of death setting his spurs to his horse, he gave so brave a charge upon the enemy, as it grew a proverb that Polycrates was only valiant after his head was off.
   But no man escaped so well his hands as Phebilus did: for he having long loved Philoclea, though for the meanness of his estate he never durst reveal it, now knowing Amphialus, setting the edge of a rival upon the sword of an enemy, he held strong fight with him. But Amphialus had already in the dangerousest places disarmed him, and was lifting up his sword to send him away from himself, when he thinking indeed to die, ‘O Philoclea,’ said he, ‘yet this joys me that I die for thy sake.’ The name of Philoclea first stayed his sword, and when he heard him out, though he abhorred him much worse than before, yet could he not vouchsafe him the honour of dying for Philoclea, but turned his sword another way, doing him no hurt for over-much hatred. But what good did that to poor Phebilus, if escaping a valiant hand, he was slain by a base soldier who, seeing him so disarmed, thrust him through?
   
   
   
   CHAPTER 8
   Thus with the well-followed valour of Amphialus were the others almost overthrown, when Philanax, who was the marshal of the army, came in, with new force renewing the almost decayed courage of his soldiers. For crying to them, and asking them whether their backs or their arms were better fighters, he himself thrust into the press, and making force and fury wait upon discretion and government, he might seem a brave lion who taught his young lionets how, in taking a prey, to join courage with cunning. Then fortune, as if she had made chases enough of the one side of that bloody tennis-court, went of the other side the line, making as many fall down of Amphialus’ followers as before had done of Philanax’s, they losing the ground as fast as before they had won it, only leaving them to keep it who had lost themselves in keeping it. Then those that had killed inherited the lot of those that had been killed; and cruel death made them lie quietly together who most in their lives had sought to disquiet each other; and many of those first overthrown had the comfort to see their murderers over-run them to Charon’s ferry.
   Codrus, Ctesiphon and Milo lost their lives upon Philanax's sword. But nobody's case was more pitied than of a young esquire of Amphialus called Ismenus, who, never abandoning his master, and making his tender age aspire to acts of the strongest manhood, in this time that his side was put to the worst, and that Amphialus’ valour was the only stay of them from delivering themselves over to a shameful flight, he saw his master’s horse killed under him. Whereupon asking advice of no other thought but of faithfulness and courage, he presently lighted from his own horse, and with the help of some choice and faithful servants, gat his master up. But in the multitude that came of either side, some to succour, some to save Amphialus, he came under the hand of Philanax: and the youth perceiving he was the man that did most hurt to his party, desirous even to change his life for glory, strake at him as he rode by him, and gave him a hurt upon the leg that made Philanax turn towards him; but seeing him so young, and of a most lovely presence, he rather took pity of him, meaning to make him prisoner and then to give him to his brother Agenor to be his companion, because they were not much unlike, neither in years nor countenance. But as he looked down upon him with that thought, he spied where his brother lay dead, and his friend Leontius by him, even almost under the squire’s feet. Then sorrowing not only his own sorrow, but the past-coinfort sorrow which he foreknew his mother would take (who with many tears and misgiving sighs had suffered him to go with his elder brother), Philanax blotted out all figures of pity out of his mind, and putting forth his horse (while Ismenus doubled two or three more valiant than well-set blows) saying to himself, ‘Let other mothers bewail an untimely death as well as mine,’ he thrust him through. And the boy fierce though beautiful, and beautiful though dying, not able to keep his failing feet, fell down to the earth, which he bit for anger, repining at his fortune and, as long as he could, resisting death, which might seem unwilling too, so long he was in taking away his young struggling soul.
   Philanax himself could have wished the blow ungiven, when he saw him fall like a fair apple which some uncourteous body, breaking his bough, should throw down before it were ripe. But the case of his brother made him forget both that and himself; so as over- hastily pressing upon the retiring enemies, he was (ere he was aware) further engaged than his own soldiers could relieve him; where being overthrown by Amphialus, Amphialus, glad of him, kept head against his enemies, while some of his men carried away Philanax.
   But Philanax’s men, as if with the loss of Philanax they had lost the fountain of their valour, had their courage so dried up in fear that they began to set honour at their backs and to use the virtue of patience in an untimely time; when into the press comes (as hard as his horse, more afraid of the spur than the sword, could carry him) a knight in armour as dark as blackness could make it, followed by none, and adorned by nothing; so far without authority that he was without knowledge. But virtue quickly made him known, and admiration bred him such authority that though they of whose side he came knew him not, yet they all knew it was fit to obey him; and while he was followed by the valiantest, he made way for the vilest. For taking part with the besiegers, he made the Amphialians’ blood serve for a caparison to his horse and a decking to his armour. His arm no oftener gave blows, than the blows gave wounds, than the wounds gave deaths; so terrible was his force, and yet was his quickness more forcible than his force, and his judgement more quick than his quickness. For though his sword went faster than eyesight could follow it, yet his own judgement went still before it. There died of his hand Sarpedon, Plistonax, Strophilus and Hippolitus, men of great proof in wars, and who had that day undertaken the guard of Amphialus. But while they sought to save him, they lost the fortresses that Nature had placed them in. Then slew he Megalus, who was a little before proud to see himself stained in the blood of his enemies, but when his own blood came to be married to theirs, he then felt that cruelty doth never enjoy a good cheap glory. After him sent he Palemon who had that day vowed, with foolish bravery, to be the death of ten; and nine already he had killed, and was careful to perform his (almost performed) vow, when the black knight helped him to make up the tenth himself.
   And now the often-changing fortune began also to change the hue of the battles. For at the first, though it were terrible, yet terror was decked so bravely with rich furniture, gilt swords, shining armours, pleasant pencels that the eye with delight had scarce leisure to be afraid: but now all universally defiled with dust, blood, broken armours, mangled bodies, took away the mask, and set forth horror in his own horrible manner. But neither could danger be dreadful to Amphialus’ undismayable courage, nor yet seem ugly to him whose truly-affected mind did still paint it over with the beauty of Philoclea: and therefore he (rather inflamed than troubled with the increase of dangers, and glad to find a worthy subject to exercise his courage) sought out this new knight, whom he might easily find: for he, like a wanton rich man that throws down his neighbours’ houses to make himself the better prospect, so had his sword made him so spacious a room that Amphialus had more cause to wonder at the finding than labour for the seeking: which, if it stirred hate in him to see how much harm he did to the one side, it provoked as much emulation in him to perceive how much good he did to the other side. Therefore, they approaching one to the other, as in two beautiful folks love naturally stirs a desire of joining, so in their two courages hate stirred a desire of trial.
   Then began there a combat between them worthy to have had more large lists and more quiet beholders, for with the spur of courage and the bit of respect each so guided himself, that one might well see the desire to overcome made them not forget how to' overcome. In such time and proportion they did employ their blows that none of Ceres’ servants could more cunningly place his flail. while the left foot spur set forward his own horse, the right set backward the contrary horse, even sometimes by the advantage of the enemy’s leg, while the left hand (like him that held the stern) guided the horse’s obedient courage: all done in such order that it might seem the mind was a right prince indeed, who sent wise and diligent lieutenants into each of those well-governed parts. But the more they fought, the more they desired to fight; and the more they smarted, the less they felt the smart: and now were like to make a quick proof to whom fortune or valour would seem most friendly, when in comes an old governor of Amphialus, always a good knight and careful of his charge, who giving a sore wound to the black knight’s thigh, while he thought not of him, with another blow slew his horse under him. Amphialus cried to him that he dishonoured him:
   ‘You say well,’ answered the old knight, ‘to stand now like a private soldier, setting your credit upon particular fighting, while you may see Basilius with all his host is getting between you and your town.’
   He looked that way and found that true indeed, that the enemy was beginning to encompass him about and stop his return: and therefore causing the retreat to be sounded, his governor led his men homeward, while he kept himself still hindmost, as if he had stood at the gate of a sluice to let the stream go with such proportion as should seem good unto him; and with so manful discretion performed it that (though with loss of many of his men) he returned in himself safe, and content that his enemies had felt how sharp the sword could bite of Philoclea’s lover. The other party, being sorry for the loss of Philanax, was yet sorrier when the Black Knight could not be found: for he, having gotten a horse whom his dying master had bequeathed to the world, finding himself sore hurt, and not desirous to be known, had in the time of the enemies’ retiring retired away also, his thigh not bleeding blood so fast as his heart bled revenge. But Basilius, having attempted in vain to bar the safe return of Amphialus, encamped himself as strongly as he could, while he, to his grief, might hear the joy was made in the town by his own subjects that he had that day sped no better. For Amphialus, being well beloved of that people, when they saw him not vanquished, they esteemed him as victorious, his youth setting a flourishing show upon his worthiness and his great nobility ennobling his dangers.
   CHAPTER 9
   But the first thing Amphialus did, being returned, was to visit Philoclea, and first presuming to cause his dream to be sung unto her which he had seen the night before he fell in love with her, making a fine boy he had accord a pretty dolefulness unto it
   The song was this:
Now was our heavenly vault deprived of the light 
With sun’s depart; and now the darkness of the night 
Did light those beamy stars which greater light did dark:
Now each thing that enjoy’d that fiery quick’ning spark 
(Which life is call’d) were mov’d their spirits to repose,
And wanting use of eyes, their eyes began to close.
A silence sweet each where with one consent embrac'd,
(A music sweet to one in careful musing plac’d);
And mother earth, now clad in mourning weeds, did breathe 
A dull desire to kiss the image of our death;
When I, disgraced wretch, not wretched then, did give



My senses such relief as they which quiet live,
"Whose brains boil not in woes, nor breasts with beatings ache, 
With nature’s praise are wont in safest home to take.
Far from my thoughts was aught whereto their minds aspire 
Who under courtly pomps do hatch a base desire.
Free all my powers were from those captiving snares 
Which heav’nly purest gifts defile with muddy cares.
Ne could my soul itself accuse of such a fault 
As tender conscience might with furious pangs assault 
But like the feeble flower (whose stalk cannot sustain 
His weighty top) his top downward doth drooping lean,
Or as the silly bird in well-acquainted nest 
Doth hide his head with cares, but only how to rest;
So I in simple course, and unentangled mind,
Did suffer drowsy lids mine eyes, then clear, to blind;
And laying down mine head, did nature’s rule observe,
Which senses up doth shut the senses to preserve.
They first their youth forgot, then fancies lost their force,
Till deadly sleep at length possess’d my living corse.
A living corse I lay: but ah, my wakeful mind
(Which, made of heav’nly stuff, no mortal change doth blind)
Hew up with freer wings, of fleshly bondage free,
And having plac’d my thoughts, my thoughts thus placed me: 
Methought, nay sure I was, I was in fairest wood 
Of Samothea land, a land which whilom stood 
An honour to the world, while honour was their end,
And while their line of years they did in virtue spend.
But there I was, and there my calmy thoughts I fed 
On nature’s sweet repast, as healthful senses led.
Her gifts my study was, her beauties were my sport 
My work her works to know, her dwelling my resort.
Those lamps of heav’nly fire to fixed motion bound,
The ever turning spheres, the never moving ground; 
What essence dest’ny hath; if fortune be or no;
Whence our immortal souls to mortal earth do flow:
What life it is, and how that all these lives do gather, 
With outward maker’s force, or like an inward father.
Such thoughts, methought, I thought, and strain’d my single mind,
Then void of nearer cares, the depth of things to find,
When lo, with hugest noise, (such noise a tower makes 
When it blown down with wind a fall of ruin takes,
Or, such a noise it was as highest thunders send,
Or cannons thunder-like, all shot together, lend).
The moon asunder rent, whereout with sudden fall 
(More swift than falcon’s stoop to feeding falconer’s call)
There came a chariot fair, by doves and sparrows guided,
Whose storm-like course stay’d not till hard by me it bided.
I, wretch, astonished was, and thought the deathful doom 
Of heaven, of earth, of hell, of time and place was come.
But straight there issued forth two ladies (ladies sure 
They seemed to me) on whom did wait a virgin pure.
Strange were the ladies’ weeds, yet more unfit than strange.
The first with clothes tucked up, as nymphs in woods do range, 
Tucked up even with the knees, with bow and arrows prest:
Her right arm naked was, discovered was her breast 
But heavy was her pace, and such a meagre cheer,
As little hunting mind, God knows, did there appear.
The other had with art (more than our women know,
As stuff meant for the sale set out to glaring show)
A wanton woman’s face, and with curl’d knots had twin’d 
Her hair, which by the help of painters’ cunning, shin'd.
When I such guests did see come out of such a house,
The mountains great with child I thought brought forth a mouse.
But walking forth, the first thus to the second said,
'Venus, come on.’ Said she, ‘Diana, you are obey’d.’
Those names abash’d me much, when those great names I heard, 
Although their fame (me seem’d) from truth had greatly jarr’d. 
As I thus musing stood, Diana call’d to her 
The waiting nymph, a nymph that did excel as far
All things that erst I saw, as orient pearls exceed
That which their mother hight, or else their silly seed:
Indeed a perfect hew, indeed a sweet concent
Of all those Graces’ gifts the heavens have ever lent.
And so she was attir’d as one that did not prize
Too much her peerless parts, nor yet could them despise.
But call’d, she came apace; a pace, wherein did move 
The band of beauties all, the little world of love.
And bending humble eyes (O eyes, the sun of sight)
She waited mistress’ will; who thus disclos’d her sprite:
‘Sweet Mira mine,’ quoth she, ‘the pleasure of my mind,
In whom of all my rules the perfect proof I find,
To only thee, thou seest, we grant this special grace 
Us to attend, in this most private time and place.
Be silent therefore now, and so be silent still 
Of that thou seest; close up in secret knot thy will.’
She answered was with look, and well perform’d behest:
And Mira I admir’d; her shape sank in my breast.
But thus with ireful eyes and face that shook with spite,
Diana did begin, ‘What mov’d me to invite 
Your presence, sister dear, first to my moony sphere,
And hither now, vouchsafe to take with willing ear.
I know full well you know what discord long hath reign’d 
Betwixt us two: how much that discord foul hath stain’d 
Both our estates, while each the other did deprave,
Proof speaks too much to us that feeling trial have.
Our names are quite forgot, our temples are defac’d;
Our offerings spoil’d, our priests from priesthood are displac’d. 
Is this the fruit of strife, those thousand churches high,
Those thousand altars fair now in the dust to lie?
In mortal minds, our minds but planets’ names preserve;
No knees once bowed, forsooth, for them they say we serve.
Are we their servants grown? No doubt, a noble stay; 
Celestial powers to worms, Jove’s children serve to clay!
But such they say we be; this praise our discord bred,
While we for mutual spite a striving passion fed.
But let us wiser be; and what foul discord brake,
So much more strong again let fastest concord make.
Our years do it require; you see we both do feel 
The weak’ning work of time’s for ever whirling wheel. 
Although we be divine, our grandsire Saturn is 
With age's force decay’d, yet once the heaven was his. 
And now before we seek, by wise Apollo’s skill,
Our young years to renew, for so he saith he will,
Let us a perfect peace between us two resolve;
Which, lest the ruinous want of government dissolve,
Let one the princess be, to her the other yield;
For vain equality is but contention’s field.
And let her have the gifts that should in both remain;
In her let beauty both and chasteness fully reign.
So as if I prevail, you give your gifts to me;
If you, on you I lay what in my office be.
Now resteth only this, which of us two is she,
To whom precedence shall of both accorded be.
For that (so that you like) hereby doth lie a youth,’
(She beckoned unto me) ‘as yet of spotless truth,
Who may this doubt discern: for better wit than lot, 
Becometh us: in us fortune determines not.
This crown of amber fair’ (an amber crown she held)
‘To worthiest let him give, when both he hath beheld;
And be it as he saith.’Venus was glad to hear
Such proffer made, which she well show’d with smiling cheer,
As though she were the same, as when by Paris' doom,
She had chief goddesses in beauty overcome.
And smirkly thus gan say, ‘I never sought debate,
Diana dear; my mind to love and not to hate 
Was ever apt; but you my pastimes did despise.
I never spited you, but thought you overwise.
Now kindness proferr’d is, none kinder is than I;
And so most ready am this mean of peace to try;
And let him be our judge: the lad doth please me well.
Thus both did come to me, and both began to tell 
(For both together spake, each loth to be behind)
That they by solemn oath their deities would bind 
To stand unto my will: their will they made me know.
I that was first aghast, when first I saw their show,
Now bolder wax’d, wax’d proud that I such sway must bear; 
For near acquaintance doth diminish reverent fear.
And having bound them fast by Styx they should obey 
To all what I decreed, did thus my verdict say:
'How ill both you can rule well hath your discord taught;
Ne yet, for aught I see, your beauties merit aught.
To yonder Nymph therefore’ (to Mira I did point)
‘The crown above you both for ever I appoint’
I would have spoken out, but out they both did cry,
‘Fie, fie, what have we done? Ungodly rebel, fie!
But now we needs must yield to that our oaths require.
Yet tnou shalt not go free,’ quoth Venus. ‘Such a fire
Her beauty kindle shall within thy foolish mind
That thou full oft shalt wish thy judging eyes were blind.’
‘Nay then,’ Diana said, ‘the chasteness I will give 
In ashes of despair, though burnt, shall make thee live.’
‘Nay thou,’ said both, ‘shalt see such beams shine in her face. 
That thou shalt never dare seek help of wretched case.’
And with that cursed curse away to heaven they fled,
First having all their gifts upon fair Mira spread.
The rest I cannot tell, for therewithal I wak’d,
And found with deadly fear that all my sinews shak’d.
Was it a dream? O dream, how hast thou wrought in me,
That I things erst unseen should first in dreaming see?
And thou, O traitor sleep, made for to be our rest,
How hast thou fram'd the pain wherewith I am oppress’d?
O coward Cupid, thus dost thou thy honour keep,
Unarm’d (alas) unwarn’d, to take a man asleep?
   Laying not only the conquests, but the heart of the conqueror at her feet … But she receiving him after her wonted sorrowful (but otherwise unmoved) manner, it made him think his good success was but as a pleasant monument of a doleful burial, joy itself seeming bitter unto him, since it agreed not to her taste.
   Therefore, still craving his mother’s help to persuade her, he himself sent for Philanax unto him, whom he had not only long hated but now had his hate greatly increased by the death of his squire Ismenus. Besides, he had made him as one of the chief causes that moved him to this rebellion, and therefore was inclined (to colour the better his action, and the more to embrew the hands of his accomplices by making them guilty of such a trepass) in some formal sort to cause him to be executed, being also greatly egged thereunto by his mother and some other, who long had hated Philanax only because he was more worthy than they to be loved.
   But while that deliberation was handled according rather to the humour than the reason of each speaker, Philoclea coming to knowledge of the hard plight wherein Philanax stood, she desired one of the gentlewomen appointed to wait upon her to go in her name and beseech Amphialus that, if the love of her had any power of persuasion in his mind, he would lay no further punishment than imprisonment upon Philanax. This message was delivered even as Philanax was entering to the presence of Amphialus, coming, according to the warning was given him, to receive a judgement of death. But when he, with manful resolution, attended the fruit of such a tyrannical sentence, thinking it wrong but no harm to him that should die in so good a cause, Amphialus turned quite the form of his pretended speech, and yielded him humble thanks that by his means he had come to that happiness as to receive a commandment of his lady: and therefore he willingly gave him liberty to return in safety whither he would, quitting him not only of all former grudge, but assuring him that he would be willing to do him any friendship and service: only desiring thus much of him, that he would let him know the discourse and intent of Basilius’ proceeding.
   ‘Truly, my Lord,’ answered Philanax, ‘if there were any such known to me, secret in my master's counsel, as that the revealing thereof might hinder his good success, I should loathe the keeping of my blood with the loss of my faith, and would think the just name of a traitor a hard purchase of a few years’ living. But since it is so that my master hath indeed no way of privy practice, but means openly and forcibly to deal against you, I will not stick, in few words, to make your required declaration.’
   Then told he him in what a maze of amazement both Basilius and Gynecia were when they missed their children and Zelmane; sometimes apt to suspect some practice of Zelmane, because she was a stranger; sometimes doubting some relics of the late mutiny, which doubt was rather increased than any wise satisfied by Miso, who, being found almost dead for hunger by certain country people, brought home word with what cunning they were trained out and with what violence they were carried away. But that within, a few days they came to knowledge where they were by Amphialus’ own letters sent abroad to procure confederates in his attempts. That Basilius’ purpose was never to leave the siege of this town till he had taken it, and revenged the injury done unto him. That he meant rather to win it by time and famine than by force of assault, knowing how valiant men he had to deal withal in the town: that he had sent order that supplies of soldiers, pioneers, and all things else necessary, should daily be brought unto him, so as, ‘My Lord,’ said Philanax, ‘let me now, having received my life by your grace, let me give you your life and honour by my counsel; protesting unto you that I cannot choose but love you, being my master's nephew, and that I wish you well in all causes but this. You know his nature is as apt to forgive as his power is able to conquer. Your fault past is excusable, in that love persuaded and youth was persuaded. Do not urge the effects of angry victory, but rather seek to obtain that constantly by courtesy which you can never assuredly enjoy by violence.’
   One might easily have seen in the cheer of Amphialus that disdainful choler would fain have made the answer for him, but the remembrance of Philoclea served for forcible barriers between anger and angry effects; so as he said no more, but that he would not put him to the trouble to give him any further counsel, but that he might return, if he listed, presently. Philanax glad to receive an uncorrupted liberty, humbly accepted his favourable convoy out of the town; and so departed,not visiting the princesses, thinking it might be offensive to Amphialus, and no way fruitful to them who were no way, but by force, to be rescued.
   The poor ladies, indeed, not suffered either to meet together, or to have conference with any other but such as Cecropia had already framed to sing all their songs to her tune; she herself omitting no day, and catching hold of every occasion to move forward her son’s desire and remove their own resolutions; using the same arguments to the one sister as to the other; determining that whom she could win first, the other should (without her son’s knowledge) by poison be made away. But though the reasons were the same to both, yet the handling was diverse, according as she saw their humours to prepare a more or less aptness of apprehension: this day having used long speech to Philoclea, amplifying not a little the great dutifulness her son had showed in delivering Philanax; of whom she could get no answer but a silence sealed up in virtue, and so sweetly graced as that in one instant it carried with it both resistance and humbleness.
   CHAPTER 10
   Cecropia, threatening in herself to run a more rugged race with her, went to her sister Pamela, who that day (having wearied herself with reading, and with the height of her heart disdaining to keep company with any of the gentlewomen appointed to attend her, whom she accounted her jailors) was working upon a purse certain roses and lilies, as by the fineness of the work one might see she had borrowed her wits of the sorrow that then owed them, and lent them wholly to that exercise. For the flowers she had wrought carried such life in them that the cunningest painter might have learned of her needle, which with so pretty a manner made his careers to and fro through the cloth, as if the needle itself would have been loth to have gone fromward such a mistress but that it hoped to return thitherward very quickly again; the cloth looking with many eyes upon her, and lovingly embracing the wounds she gave it The shears also were at hand to behead the silk that was grown too short: and if at any time she put her mouth to bite it off, it seemed that where she had been long in making of a rose with her hands, she would in an instant make roses with her lips, as the lilies seemed to have their whiteness rather of the hand that made them than of the matter whereof they were made, and that they grew there by the suns of her eyes, and were refreshed by the most in difcomfort-comfort- able air which an unwares sigh might bestow upon them. But the colours for the ground were so well chosen - neither sullenly dark nor glaringly lightsome, and so well proportioned as that, though much cunning were in it, yet it was but to serve for an ornament of the principal work - that it was not without marvel to see how a mind which could cast a careless semblant upon the greatest conflicts of fortune could command itself to take care for so small matters. Neither had she neglected the dainty dressing of her self; but as if it had been her marriage time to affliction, she rather seemed to remember her own worthiness than the unworthiness of her husband. For well one might perceive she had not rejected the counsel of a glass, and that her hands had pleased themselves in paying the tribute of undeceiving skill to so high perfections of nature.
   The sight whereof so diverse from her sister (who rather suffered sorrow to dress itself in her beauty than that she would bestow any entertainment of so unwelcome a guest) made Cecropia take a sudden assuredness of hope that she should obtain somewhat of Pamela; thinking, according to the squaring out of her own good nature, that beauty carefully set forth would soon prove a sign of an unrefusing harbour. Animated wherewith, she sat down by Pamela, and taking the purse, and with affected curiosity looking upon the work:
   ‘Fully happy is he,’ said she, ‘at least if he knew his own happiness, to whom a purse in this manner, and by this hand wrought, is dedicated. In faith he shall have cause to account it not as a purse for treasure but as a treasure itself, worthy to be pursed up in the purse of his own heart.'
   ‘And think you so indeed?’ said Pamela, half smiling, ‘I promise you I wrought it but to make some tedious hours believe that I thought not of them; for else I valued it but even as a very purse.'
   ‘It is the right nature,’ said Cecropia, ‘of beauty to work unwitting effects of wonder.’
   Truly,' said Pamela, ‘I never thought till now that this outward gloss, entitled beauty, which it pleaseth you to lay to my (as I think) unguilty charge, was but a pleasant mixture of natural colours, delightful to the eye as music is to the ear, without any further consequence, since it is a thing which not only beasts have, but even stones and trees, many of them, do greatly excel in it.’
   ‘That other things,’ answered Cecropia, ‘have some portion of it takes not away the excellency of it where indeed it doth excel, since we see that even those beasts, trees and stones are in the name of beauty only highly praised. But that the beauty of human persons be beyond all other things there is great likelihood of reason, since to them only is given the judgement to discern beauty; and among reasonable wights, as it seems, that our sex hath the pre-eminence, so that in that pre-eminence Nature countervails all other liberalities, wherein she may be thought to have dealt more favourably toward mankind. How do men crown, think you, themselves with glory for having either by force brought others to yield to their mind, or with long study and premeditated orations persuaded what they would have persuaded! And see, a fair woman shall not only command without authority but persuade without speaking. She shall not need to procure attention, for their own eyes will chain their ears unto it. Men venture lives to conquer; she conquers lives without venturing. She is served and obeyed, which is the most notable not because the laws so command it, but because they become laws to themselves to obey her; not for her parents’ sake, but for her own. She need not dispute whether to govern by fear or love since, without her thinking thereof, their love will bring forth fear, and their fear will fortify their love; and she need not seek offensive or defensive force, since her only lips may stand for ten thousand shields, and ten thousand unevitable shot go from her eyes. Beauty, beauty, dear niece, is the crown of the feminine greatness which gift on whomsoever the heavens (therein most niggardly) do bestow, without question she is bound to use it to the noble purpose for which it is created; not only winning but preserving, since that indeed is the right happiness which is not only in itself happy but can also derive the happiness to another.’
   ‘Certainly, Aunt,’ said Pamela, ‘I fear me you will make me not only think myself fairer than ever I did, but think my fairness a matter of greater value than heretofore I could imagine it. For I ever, till now, conceived those conquests you speak of rather to proceed from the weakness of the conquered than from the strength of the conquering power; as they say, the Cranes overthrow whole battles of Pygmies not so much of their cranish courage as because the other are Pygmies; and that we see young babes think babies of wonderful excellency, and yet the babies are but babies. But since your elder years and abler judgement find beauty to be worthy of so incomparable estimation, certainly, methinks, it ought to be held in dearness, according to the excellency, and no more than we would do of things which we account precious ever to suffer it to be defiled.’
   ‘Defiled?’ said Cecropia, ‘Marry, God forbid that my speech should tend to any such purpose as should deserve so foul a title. My meaning is, to join your beauty to love, your youth to delight. For, truly, as colours should be as good as nothing if there were no eyes to behold them, so is beauty nothing, without the eye of love behold it: and therefore so far is it from defiling it that it is the only honouring of it, the only preserving of it; for beauty goes away, devoured by time, but where remains it ever flourishing but in the heart of a true lover? And such a one, if ever there were any, is my son, whose love is so subjected unto you, that rather than breed any offence unto you, it will not delight itself in beholding you.’
   ‘There is no effect of his love,’ answered Pamela, ‘better pleaseth me than that; but as I have often answered you, so resolutely I say unto you, that he must get my parents’ consent, and then he shall know further of my mind: for, without that I know I should offend God.’
   ‘O sweet youth,’ said Cecropia, ‘how untimely subject it is to devotion! No, no, sweet niece, let us old folks think of such precise considerations: do you enjoy the heaven of your age, whereof you are sure; and like good householders which spend those things that will not be kept, so do you pleasantly enjoy that which else will bring an over-late repentance, when your glass shall accuse you to your face what a change there is in you. Do you see how the spring-time is full of flowers, decking itself with them, and not aspiring to the fruits of autumn? What lesson is that unto you, but that in the April of your age you should be like April? Let not some of them for whom already the grave gapeth, and perhaps envy the felicity in you which themselves cannot enjoy, persuade you to lose the hold of occasion while it may not only be taken, but offers, nay sues to be taken; which, if it be not now taken, will never hereafter be overtaken. Yourself know how your father hath refused all offers made by the greatest princes about you; and will you suffer your beauty to be hidden in the wrinkles of his peevish thoughts?’
   ‘If he be peevish,’ said Pamela, ‘yet is he my father; and how beautiful soever I be, I am his daughter; so as God claims at my hands obedience, and makes me no judge of his imperfections.’
   These often replies upon conscience in Pamela made Cecropia think that there was no righter way for her than, as she had (in her opinion) set her in liking of beauty with persuasion not to suffer it to be void of purpose, so if she could make her less feeling of those heavenly conceits, that then she might easily wind her to her crooked bias. Therefore employing the uttermost of her mischievous wit, and speaking the more earnestly because she spake as she thought, she thus dealt with her.
   ‘Dear niece, or rather, dear daughter (if my affection and wish might prevail therein) how much doth it increase, trow you, the earnest desire I have of this blessed match to see these virtues of yours knit fast with such zeal of devotion, indeed the best bond which the most politic wits have found to hold man’s wit in well doing! For as children must first by fear be induced to know that which after, when they do know, they are most glad of, so are these bugbears of opinions brought by great clerks into the world to serve as shewels to keep them from those faults whereto else the vanity of the world and weakness of senses might pull them. But in you, niece, whose excellency is such as it need not to be held up by the staff of vulgar opinions, I would not you should love virtue servilely, for fear of I know not what which you see not, but even for the good effects of virtue which you see. Fear, and indeed, foolish fear, and fearful ignorance, was the first inventor of those conceits; for when they heard it thunder, not knowing the natural cause, they thought there was some angry body above that spake so loud; and ever the less they did perceive, the more they did conceive. Whereof they knew no cause, that grew straight a miracle; foolish folks not marking that the alterations be but upon particular accidents, the universality being always one. Yesterday was but as today, and tomorrow will tread the same footsteps of his foregoers: so as it is manifest enough that all things follow but the course of their own nature, saving only man, who while by the pregnancy of his imagination he strives to things supernatural, meanwhile he loseth his own natural felicity. Be wise, and that wisdom shall be a God unto thee. Be contented, and that is thy heaven: for-else to think that those powers (if there be any such) above are moved either by the eloquence of our prayers or in a chafe at the folly of our actions carries as much reason, as if flies should think that men take great care which of them hums sweetest, and which of them flies nimblest.’
   She would have spoken further to have enlarged and confirmed her discourse, when Pamela, whose cheeks were dyed in the beautifullest grain of virtuous anger, with eyes which glistered forth beams of disdain, thus interrupted her.
   ‘Peace, wicked woman, peace, unworthy to breathe that dost not acknowledge the breath-giver; most unworthy to have a tongue which speaketh against him through whom thou speakest: keep your affection to yourself which, like a bemired dog, would defile with fawning. You say yesterday was as today. O foolish woman, and most miserably foolish since wit makes you foolish! What doth that argue but that there is a constancy in the everlasting governor? Would you have an inconstant God, since we count a man foolish that is inconstant? He is not seen, you say: and would you think him a God who might be seen by so wicked eyes as yours? - which yet might see enough if they were not like such who, for sport's sake, willingly hoodwink themselves to receive blows the easier. But though I speak to you without any hope of fruit in so rotten a heart, and there be nobody else here to judge of my speeches, yet be thou my witness, O captivity, that my ears shall not be willingly guilty of my Creator’s blasphemy.
   You say, because we know not the causes of things, therefore fear was the mother of superstition. Nay, because we know, that each effect hath a cause, that hath engendered a true and lively devotion. For this goodly work of which we are, and in which we live, hath not his being by chance; on which opinion it is beyond marvel by what chance any brain could stumble. For if it be eternal, as you would seem to conceive of it, eternity and chance are things unsufferable together. For that is chanceable which hap- peneth; and if it happen, there was a time before it happened when it might have not happened, or else it did not happen; and so, if chanceable, not eternal, as now being, then not being. And as absurd it is to think that if it had a beginning, his beginning was derived from chance: for chance could never make all things of nothing; and if there were substances before, which by chance should meet to make up this work, thereon follows another bottomless pit of absurdities. For then those substances must needs have been from ever, and so eternal: and that eternal causes should bring forth chanceable effects is as sensible as that the sun should be the author of darkness. Again, if it were chanceable, then was it not necessary; whereby you take away all consequents. But we see in all things, in some respect or other, necessity of consequence: therefore in reason we must needs know that the causes were necessary.
   ‘Lastly, chance is variable, or else it is not to be called chance: but we see this work is steady and permanent. If nothing but chance had glued those pieces of this All, the heavy parts would have gone infinitely downward, the light infinitely upward, and so never have met to have made up this goodly body. For before there was a heaven or earth, there was neither a heaven to stay the height of the rising, nor an earth, which (in respect of the round walls of heaven) should become a centre. Lastly, perfect order, perfect beauty, perfect constancy, if these be the children of chance, or Fortune the efficient of these, let wisdom be counted the root of wickedness, and eternity the fruit of her inconstancy.
   ‘But, you will say, it is so by nature, as much ES if you said, it is so because it is so. If you mean of many natures conspiring together as in a popular government to establish this fair estate, as if the elementish and ethereal parts should in their town-house set down the bounds of each one’s office, then consider what follows: that there must needs have been a wisdom which made them concur; for their natures, being absolute contrary, in nature rather would have sought each others’ ruin than have served as well consorted parts to such an unexpressible harmony. For that contrary things should meet to make up a perfection, without a force and wisdom above their powers, is absolutely impossible, unless you will fly to that hissed-out opinion of chance again. But you may, perhaps, affirm that one universal Nature, which hath been for ever, is the knitting together of these many parts to such an excellent unity. If you mean a Nature of wisdom, goodness and providence, which knows what it doth, then say you that which I seek of you, and cannot conclude those blasphemies with which you defiled your mouth and mine ears. But if you mean a nature, as we speak of the fire which goeth upward, it knows not why; and of the nature of the sea, which in ebbing and flowing seems to observe so just a dance, and yet understands no music, it is but still the same absurdity superscribed with another title. For this word, One, being attributed to that which is All, is but one mingling of many, and many ones; as in a less matter, when we say one kingdom which contains many cities, or one city which contains many persons, wherein the under-ones (if there be not a superior power and wisdom) cannot by nature regard to any preservation but of themselves: no more we see they do, since the water willingly quenches the fire and drowns the earth, so far are they from a conspired unity, but that a right heavenly Nature indeed (as it were) unnaturing them, doth so bridle them.
   ‘Again, it is as absurd in Nature that from an unity many contraries should proceed still kept in an unity, as that from the number of contrarieties an unity should arise. I say still, if you banish both a singularity and plurality of judgement from among them, then (if so earthly a mind can lift itself up so high) do but conceive how a thing whereto you give the highest and most excellent kind of being (which is eternity) can be of the base and vilest degree of being and next to a not-being, which is so to be as not to enjoy his own being. I will not here call all your senses to witness, which can hear nor see nothing which yields not most evident evidence of the unspeakableness of that wisdom; each thing being directed to an end, and an end of preservation, so proper effects of judgement, as speaking and laughing are of mankind.
   ‘But what mad fury can ever so inveigle any conceit as to see our mortal and corruptible selves to have a reason, and that this universality (whereof we are but the least pieces) should be utterly devoid thereof; as if one should say that one’s foot might be wise, and himself foolish? This heard I once alleged against such a godless mind as yours, who being driven to acknowledge this beastly absurdity that our bodies should be better than the whole world, if it had the knowledge whereof the other were void; he sought, (not able to answer directly) to shift it off in this sort: that if that reason were true, then must it follow also that the world must have in it a spirit that could write and read too, and be learned, since that was in us commendable. Wretched fool, not considering that books be but supplies of defects and so are praised because they help our want, and therefore cannot be incident to the eternal intelligence which needs no recording of opinions to confirm his knowledge, no more than the sun wants wax to be the fuel of his glorious lightfulness.
   ‘This word therefore cannot otherwise consist but by a mind of wisdom which governs it; which whether you will allow to be the Creator thereof (as undoubtedly he is) or the soul and governor thereof, most certain it is, that whether he govern all, or make all, his power is above either his creatures or his government. And if his power be above all things, then consequently it must needs be infinite,since there is nothing above it to limit it; for beyond which there is nothing must needs be boundless and infinite. If his power be infinite, then likewise must his knowledge be infinite; for else there should be an infinite proportion of power which he should not know how to use, the unsensibleness whereof I think even you can conceive: and if infinite, then must nothing, no not the estate of flies (which you with so unsavoury scorn did jest at) be unknown unto him. For if it were, then there were his knowledge bounded, and so not infinite. If his knowledge and power be infinite, then must needs his goodness and justness march in the same rank; for infiniteness of power and knowledge, without like measure of goodness, must necessarily bring forth destruction and ruin, and not ornament and preservation.
   ‘Since then there is a God, and an all-knowing God, so as he sees into the darkest of all natural secrets which is the heart of man; and sees therein the deepest dissembled thoughts, nay sees the thoughts before they be thought; since he is just to exercise his might, and mighty to perform his justice, assure thyself, most wicked woman (that hast so plaguily a corrupted mind as thou canst not keep thy sickness to thyself, but must most wickedly infect others) assure thyself, I say (for what I say depends of everlasting and unremovable causes) that the time will come when thou shalt know that power by feeling it; when thou shalt see His wisdom in the manifesting thy ugly shamefulness, and shalt only perceive him to have been a Creator in thy destruction.’
   CHAPTER 11
   Thus she said, thus she ended, with so fair a majesty of unconquered virtue that captivity might seem to have authority over tyranny. So foully was the filthiness of impiety discovered by the shining of her unstained goodness (so far as either Cecropia saw indeed, or else the guilty amazement of a self-accusing conscience made her eyes untrue judges of their natural object) that there was a light more than human which gave a lustre to her perfections. But Cecropia (like a bat which, though it have eyes to discern that there is a sun, yet hath so evil eyes that it cannot delight in the sun) found a truth but could not love it. But as great persons are wont to make the wrong they have done to be a cause to do the more wrong, her knowledge rose to no higher point but to envy a worthier; and her will was no otherwise bent but the more to hate, the more she found her enemy provided against her.
   Yet all the while she spake (though with eyes cast like a horse that would strike at the stirrup, and with colour which blushed through yellowness) she sat rather still than quiet, and after her speech rather muttered than replied; for the war of wickedness in herself brought forth disdainful pride to resist cunning dissimulation. So as, saying little more unto her but that she should have leisure enough better to bethink herself, she went away repining but not repenting, condemning greatly, as she thought, her son’s over-feeble humbleness, and purposing to egg him forward to a course of violence: for herself, determining to deal with neither of them both any more in manner of a suitor, for what majesty of virtue did in the one, that did silent humbleness in the other. But finding her son over-apt to lay both condemnation and execution of sorrow upon himself, she sought to mitigate his mind with feigned delays of comfort, who (having this inward overthrow in himself) was the more vexed that he could not utter the rage thereof upon his outward enemies.
   For Basilius, taught by the last day’s trial what dangerous effects chosen courages can bring forth, rather used the spade than the sword, or the sword but to defend the spade, girding about the whole town with trenches; which beginning a good way off from the town, with a number of well directed pioneers he still carried before him, till they came to a near distance, where he builded forts, one answering the other, in such sort as it was a pretty consideration in the discipline of war to see building used for the instrument of ruin, and the assailer entrenched as if he was besieged. But many sallies did Amphialus make to hinder their working. But they (exercising more melancholy than choler in their resolution) made him find that if, by the advantage of place, few are able to defend themselves from many, that many must needs have power (making themselves strong in seat) to repel few, referring the revenge rather to the end than to a present requital. Yet oftentimes they dealt some blows in light skirmishes, each side having a strong retiring place, and rather fighting with many alarums to vex the enemy than for any hope of great success.
   Which every way was a tedious cumber to the impatient courage of Amphialus: till the fame of this war bringing thither divers both strangers and subjects, as well of princely as noble houses, the gallant Phalantus - who refrained his sportful delights as then, to serve Basilius (whom he honoured for received honours) - when he had spent some time in considering the Arcadian manner in marching, encamping and fighting, and had learned in what points of government and obedience their discipline differed from others, and so had satisfied his mind in the knowledges both for the cutting off the enemies’ helps and furnishing one’s self, which Basilius’ orders could deliver unto him; his young spirits (weary of wanting cause to be weary) desired to keep his valour in knowledge by some private act, since the public policy restrained him - the rather, because his old mistress Artesia might see whom she had so lightly forsaken. And therefore demanding and obtaining leave of Basilius, he caused a herald to be furnished with apparel of his office and tokens of a peaceable message, and so sent him to the gate of the town to demand audience of Amphialus; who, understanding thereof, caused him both safely and courteously to be brought into his presence. Who, making lowly reverence unto him, presented his letters, desiring Amphialus that whatsoever they contained, he would consider that he was only the bearer and not the inditer.
   Amphialus with noble gentleness assured him, both by honourable speeches and a demeanour which answered for him, that his revenge, whensoever, should sort unto itself a higher subject. But opening the letters, he found them to speak in this manner:
   Phalantus of Corinth, to Amphialus of Arcadia, sendeth the greeting of a hateless enemy. The liking of martial matters without any mislike of your person hath brought me rather to the company than to the mind of your besiegers: where, languishing in idleness, I desire to refresh my mind with some exercise of arms which might make known the doers, with delight of the beholders. Therefore if there be any gentleman in your town that, either for the love of honour or honour of his love, will armed on horseback, with lance and sword, win another or lose himself, to be a prisoner at discretion of the conqueror, I will tomorrow morning by sunrising, with a trumpet and a squire only, attend him in like order furnished. The place I think fittest, the island within the lake, because it stands so well in view of your castle as that the ladies may have the pleasure of seeing the combat: which, though it be within the commandment of your castle, I desire no better security than the promise I make to myself of your virtue. I attend your answer, and wish you such success as may be to your honour, rather in yielding to that which is just than in maintaining wrong by violence.
   Amphialus read it with cheerful countenance, and thinking but a little with himself, called for ink and paper, and wrote this answer:
   Amphialus of Arcadia, to Phalantus of Corinth, wisheth all his own wishes, saving those which may be hurtful to another. The matter of your letters so fit for a worthy mind, and the manner so suitable to the nobleness of the matter, give me cause to think how happy I might account myself if I could get such a friend, who esteem it no small happiness to have met with so noble an enemy. Your challenge shall be answered, and both time, place, and weapon accepted. For your security from any treachery (having no hostage worthy to countervail you) take my word, which I esteem above all respects. Prepare therefore your arms to fight, but not your heart to malice, since true valour needs no other whetstone than desire of honour.
   Having written and sealed his letter, he delivered it to the herald, and withal took a fair chain from off his own neck and gave it him. And so with safe convoy sent him away from out his city: and he being gone, Amphialus showed unto his mother and some other of his chief counsellors what he had received and how he had answered, telling them withal that he was determined to answer the challenge in his own person. His mother, with prayers authorized by motherly commandment; his old governor, with persuasions mingled with reprehensions, that he would rather affect the glory of a private fighter than of a wise general; Clinias with falling down at his feet and beseeching him to remember that all their lives depended upon his safety, sought all to dissuade him. But Amphialus (whose heart was inflamed with courage, and courage inflamed with affection) made an imperious resolution cut off the tediousness of replies, giving them in charge what they should do upon all occasions, and particularly to deliver the ladies, if otherwise than well happened unto him: only desiring his mother that she would bring Philoclea to a window, whence she might with ease perfectly discern the combat.
   And so, as soon as the morning began to draw dew from the fairest greens to wash her face withal against the approach of the burning sun, he went to his stable, where himself chose out a horse whom (though he was near twenty year old) he preferred for a piece of sure service, before a great number of younger. His colour was of a brown bay, dappled thick with black spots; his forehead marked with a white star, to which, in all his body, there was no part suitable but the left foot before; his mane and tail black and thick, of goodly and well proportioned greatness. He caused him to be trimmed with a sumptuous saddle of tawny and gold enamel, enriched with precious stones. His furniture was made into the fashion of the branches of a tree from which the leaves were falling; and so artificially were the leaves made that, as the horse moved, it seemed indeed that the leaves wagged as when the wind plays with them; and being made of a pale cloth of gold, they did bear the straw-coloured livery of ruin. His armour was also of tawny and gold, but formed into the figure of flames darkened as when they newly break the prison of a smoky furnace. In his shield he had painted the Torpedo fish. And so appointed, he caused himself with his trumpet and squire (whom he had taken since the death of Ismenus) to be ferried over into the island, a place well chosen for such a purpose. For it was so plain as there was scarcely any bush or hillock either to unlevel or shadow it; of length and breadth enough to try the uttermost both of lance and sword: and the one end of it facing the castle, the other extending itself towards the camp, and no access to it but by water, there could no secret treachery be wrought; and for manifest violence, either side might have time enough to succour their party.
   But there he found Phalantus already waiting for him upon a horse, milk white but that upon his shoulder and withers he was freckled with red stains as when a few strawberries are scattered into a dish of cream. He had caused his mane and tail to be dyed in carnation; his reins were vine branches which, engendering one with the other, at the end, when it came to the bit, there for the boss brought forth a cluster of grapes, by the workman made so lively that it seemed as the horse champed on his bit, he chopped for them and that it did make his mouth water to see the grapes so near him. His furniture behind was of vines, so artificially made as it seemed the horse stood in the shadow of the vine, so prettily were clusters of ruby grapes dispersed among the trappers which embraced his sides. His armour was blue like the heaven, which a sun did with his rays (proportionately delivered) gild in most places. His shield was beautified with this device: a greyhound which over-running his fellow and taking the hare, yet hurts it not when it takes it. The word was, ‘The glory, not the prey.’
   But as soon as Amphialus landed, he sent his squire to Phalantus to tell him that there was the knight ready to know whether he had anything to say to him. Phalantus answered that his answer now must be in the language of lances; and so each attended the warning of the trumpets, which were to sound at the appointment of four judges who, with consideration of the same, had divided the ground. Phalantus’ horse, young and feeling the youth of his master, stood curvetting, which being well governed by Phalantus, gave such a glittering grace as when the sun in a clear day shines upon a waving water. Amphialus’ horse stood pawing upon the ground with his further foot before, as if he would for his master’s cause begin to make himself angry: till the trumpets sounding together, together they set spurs to their horses, together took their lances from their thighs, conveyed them up into their rests together, together let them sink downward, so as it was a delectable sight in a dangerous effect; and a pleasant consideration that there was so perfect agreement in so mortal disagreement, like a music made of cunning discords. But their horses, keeping an even line their masters had skilfully allotted unto them, passed one by another without encountering, although either might feel the angry breath of other. But the staves being come to a just descent but even when the mark was ready to meet them, Amphialus was run through th
